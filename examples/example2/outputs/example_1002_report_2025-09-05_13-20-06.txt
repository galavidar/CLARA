## **4. Final Decision**  

### **Decision**: Approved  

### **Motivation**:  
The applicant demonstrates strong financial metrics overall, including a high savings rate (**54.7%**), stable income, and manageable monthly debt (**$1,000**). Their behavioral profile reinforces low liquidity stress, strong savings habits, and a lack of debt dependence. Additionally, the applicant has no history of delinquencies or bankruptcy—a key element for loan consideration.  

While the purpose of the loan (**vacation**) is discretionary, historical data indicates similar cases with non-essential purposes have been approved under similar terms. Furthermore, the applicant’s moderate risk score (**0.5905**) justifies approval at an interest rate of **10.9%** and a loan term reduced to 30 months to mitigate extended risk exposure.

## **5. Required Monthly Installments**  
**Loan Amount**: $10,000  
**Interest Rate**: 10.9%  
**Loan Term**: 30 months  

**Estimated Monthly Installment**: $373.43

## **6. Supporting Historical Case Comparisons**  
To justify the discretionary loan purpose decision, past cases with similar parameters were approved under medium-risk interest rates:  

- **Case ID [114000010]:** Loan approved for “non-critical” purpose at 11.2% interest (36-month term).  
- **Case ID [119003794]:** Loan approved for “other” purpose at 10.8% interest (30-month term).  
- **Case ID [204002285]:** Loan approved for “vacation” at 10.9% interest (30-month term).  

---

## **7. Conclusion**  
This loan is approved under adjusted terms (**$10,000 loan, 10.9% interest, 30-month term**) given the applicant’s strong financial stability, low debt-to-income ratio, and sound liquidity position. The discretionary nature of the loan purpose is managed through historical case comparisons and moderate risk assessment.
