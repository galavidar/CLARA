| Profile Name                | Score               | Reasoning                                      |

| **Discretionary Spending**  | 0 (Moderate)        | Discretionary share is ~26%. Not excessive.   |
| **Liquidity Stress**        | 0 (Low risk)        | No overdrafts observed. CC utilization stable.|
| **Growth Potential**        | 1 (High potential)  | Positive trends in income & savings behavior. |

#### **4. Financial Analysis**

- **Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio:**  
  **Calculation:**  
  \[
  \text{DTI} = \frac{\text{Monthly Debt Payments}}{\text{Monthly Income}} \times 100 
  \]
  \[
  \text{DTI} = \frac{50000}{\frac{120000}{12}} \times 100 = 41.67\%
  \]

  **Interpretation:** The applicant's DTI ratio is 41.67%, higher than the typical guideline of 35%. While this suggests moderate risk, the applicant's substantial annual income and reliable job tenure mitigate concerns.  

- **Risk Score:** 0.488 (moderate risk)  
  The applicant's risk score reflects analytical results including behavioral profiling, debt obligations, and financial metrics integrated into a weighted formula.  

- **Interest Rate Applied:** 11.5%  
  This rate is adjusted above base market rates due to observed debt dependence and category concentration risk, but remains competitive given the applicant's strong overall financial profile.  

- **Monthly Installment (Including Interest):**  
  **Calculation:**  
  Using the loan term (36 months), loan amount ($10,000), and annual interest rate (11.5%):  

  \[
  \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Loan Amount} \times \frac{\text{Rate}}{12}}{1 - \left(1 + \frac{\text{Rate}}{12}\right)^{-\text{Term}}}
  \]
  \[
  = \frac{10000 \times \frac{0.115}{12}}{1 - \left(1 + \frac{0.115}{12}\right)^{-36}}
  \]
  \[
  = 329.74
  \]

  **Result:** Monthly payment of **$329.74** over 36 months.

#### **5. Final Decision**

**Decision:** **Accepted**  

**Reasoning:**  
The applicant presents a reliable financial profile supported by high income ($120,000 annually), excellent credit score (750), and a dependable professional background (10 years as a Doctor). These factors indicate strong repayment capacity. Additionally:  

1. **Positive Indicators:**  
   - Stable income and low expense volatility.  
   - No history of delinquencies or bankruptcy.  
   - Ownership of a home, providing financial security.  

2. **Risk Mitigation:**  
   - Debt dependence and lack of savings are balanced by high discretionary spending capacity (26%) and substantial growth potential as evidenced by positive trends in income and savings.  

3. **Historical Benchmarking:**  
   Similar cases involving physicians with stable income and long tenures have shown consistent repayment for loans with DTI ratios below 45% and interest rates ranging from 5.32% to 15.99%.  

Given these insights, a competitive interest rate (11.5%) is applied to offset moderate risk, ensuring fair lending terms while aligning with the applicant’s financial stability.

#### **6. Recommendation**
The applicant is approved for a loan of $10,000 at 11.5% interest over 36 months. The debt-to-income ratio and risk score reflect manageable risk levels, and the applicant’s repayment capacity is deemed strong based on behavioral profiling, stability metrics, and historical benchmark cases.
