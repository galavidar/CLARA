## 1. Executive Summary  

The applicant, a **Doctor** with **10 years** of tenure at the current employer, requests a **USD 10,000** loan for the purchase of a vehicle. The loan is proposed for **36 months** at an **annual interest rate of 12 %** (monthly rate = 1 %).  

Overall credit quality is strong (Credit Score = 750, no delinquancies or bankruptcy) but the behavioural analytics reveal **high discretionary spending, limited liquidity, and a concentrated expense profile**. Despite these signals, the applicant’s **stable and increasing income**, **low expense volatility**, and **favourable peer‑group outcomes (7 similar loans approved with no defaults)** support an **approved** decision.  

**Decision:** **Approved** – 12 % APR, 36‑month term.

## 3. Behavioural Profile Validation  

| Behavioural Flag | Assigned Value | Rule‑Based Reasoning |
|------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Discretionary Spending Share** | **1** (High) | Discretionary share = 26 % of total spending, exceeding the 25 % high‑spend threshold. |
| **Liquidity Stress** | **1** (High) | No overdrafts, but a **‑18 %** average savings rate and expenses > income, indicating a thin liquid buffer and likely reliance on credit. |
| **Growth Potential** | **1** (Positive) | Income trending **+ $12 / month**, expenses decreasing **‑$208 / month**, and savings increasing **+ $220 / month** – a clear upward trajectory. |
| **Income Stability** | **1** (Stable) | Income standard deviation = $57.8 (≈ 1.85 % of mean), well below the 2 % volatility rule for stable earnings. |
| **Expense Volatility** | **0** (Not volatile) | Expense SD = $208.4 (~5.6 % of mean) – below the volatility trigger (≥ 6 %). |
| **Savings Habit** | **0** (Weak) | Average savings rate **‑18 %**, demonstrating no consistent saving behaviour. |
| **Debt Dependence** | **1** (High) | Credit‑card payment ratio > 1 and negative savings rate indicate reliance on revolving credit. |
| **Category Concentration Risk** | **1** (High) | Top spending category accounts for **46 %** of total outflows, exceeding the 40 % concentration risk limit. |

**Overall behavioural impression:** The applicant exhibits **high discretionary usage, limited cash‑buffer, and a concentrated spending pattern**, balanced by **stable and rising income** and **low expense volatility**. The net effect is a **moderately elevated behavioural risk**, reflected in the **risk score of 0.30** (on a 0–1 scale, where ≤ 0.4 is acceptable for this product line).

## 4. Financial Analysis  

| Metric | Calculation | Result |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Monthly Gross Income** | 120,000 / 12 | **USD 10,000** |
| **Debt‑to‑Income (DTI) – Total Debt** | 50,000 / 120,000 | **41.7 %** |
| **Proposed Loan Payment** | 10,000 × 0.01 ÷ [1 ‑ (1.01)^‑36] | **USD 332 (rounded)** |
| **Loan Payment / Income** | 332 / 10,000 | **3.3 %** |
| **Credit Utilisation (CC Ratio)** | 1.14  (provided) | **> 1** (indicates reliance on credit) |
| **Interest Rate (Annual)** | – | **12 %** |
| **Risk Score (Model Output)** | – | **0.30** |
| **Projected Savings Trend** | + $220 / month | Positive cash‑flow improvement |

**Interpretation**  

* The **DTI of 41.7 %** sits just below the conventional 43 % ceiling for conventional loans, indicating manageable existing obligations.  
* The **monthly loan instalment represents only 3.3 % of gross income**, leaving ample capacity for other expenses and the observed upward savings trend.  
* Despite a **high credit‑card payment ratio**, the applicant’s **high income stability** and **low expense volatility** mitigate the risk of repayment stress.  
* The **risk score of 0.30** falls well within the acceptable range for this loan tier (≤ 0.40).

## 5. Loan Terms & Amortisation  

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Principal** | USD 10,000 |
| **Annual Interest Rate** | 12 % (fixed) |
| **Monthly Interest Rate** | 1 % |
| **Term** | 36 months |
| **Monthly Instalment (EMI)** | **USD 332** (rounded to nearest dollar) |
| **Total Repayment** | 332 × 36 = USD 11,952 |
| **Total Interest Charged** | USD 1,952 |

## 6. Decision & Rationale  

**Decision:** **APPROVED**  

**Key Drivers for Approval**

1. **Strong Credit Profile** – Credit score 750, no delinquencies, no bankruptcy.  
2. **Stable & Growing Income** – Low income volatility, positive income trend (+$12 / month).  
3. **Acceptable Debt Metrics** – DTI 41.7 % (below the 43 % threshold) and loan payment only 3.3 % of monthly income.  
4. **Risk Model Output** – Risk score 0.30 (well within the acceptable band).  
5. **Historical Peer Evidence** – 7 comparable applications in the database were approved with identical underwriting parameters and have **no recorded defaults**.  

**Mitigating Considerations**

* High discretionary spending and limited liquidity are noted, but the applicant’s professional stability and the modest loan size relative to income provide sufficient cushion.  
* The loan term and interest rate are set to ensure the instalment remains a small proportion of disposable income, preserving the applicant’s ability to improve savings in the coming months.

**Conclusion:** The applicant’s **overall creditworthiness** outweighs the behavioural red flags. The loan is approved at the requested **12 % APR for 36 months**, with the calculated instalment of **USD 332** per month.

## 7. Appendices  

**A. Calculation of Monthly Instalment**  

\[
\text{r} = \frac{0.12}{12}=0.01
\]  

\[
\text{EMI}= \frac{P \times r}{1-(1+r)^{-n}} = \frac{10{,}000 \times 0.01}{1-(1.01)^{-36}} \approx \frac{100}{0.301}=332
\]

| Expense std‑dev ≥ 6 % of mean | Volatile (not met) |
| Top‑category share > 40 % | Concentration risk |
| CC‑payment ratio > 1 | Debt dependence |

**C. Peer Comparison Summary**
