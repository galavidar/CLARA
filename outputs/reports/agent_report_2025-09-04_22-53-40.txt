#### **2. Behavioural Profile Validation and Reasoning**  

The applicant’s financial behavior has been assessed against standard metrics, and their profile is characterized as follows:  

1. **Discretionary Spending Share:**  
   The applicant demonstrates balanced spending, with **26.9%** of discretionary funds spent on non-essentials. This indicates responsible allocation of discretionary income.  

2. **Liquidity Stress:**  
   Evidence of **no overdrafts** and a **credit card payment ratio exceeding 1.0** reflects disciplined cash flow management and low reliance on debt instruments.  

3. **Growth Potential:**  
   Concerning negative trends include:  
       - **Declining income** (-$86/month),  
       - **Significant savings reduction** (-$1,169/month), and  
       - **Rising expenses** (+$1,084/month).  
   These trends reduce confidence in the applicant’s future financial growth prospects.  

4. **Income Stability:**  
   The applicant’s income exhibits **low volatility**, with a standard deviation of **$131** suggesting reliable monthly earnings despite the income trend’s gradual decline.  

5. **Expense Volatility:**  
   Fluctuations in expenses are notably high, with a standard deviation of **$1,088**, reflecting irregular spending patterns that may amplify liquidity risks during periods of heightened financial stress.  

6. **Savings Habit:**  
   A **moderately high savings rate** of 46.5% is mitigated by significant declines in savings (-$1,169/month), suggesting a lack of sustained consistency in financial planning.

   The applicant demonstrates low reliance on debt, with manageable monthly obligations and reasonable credit card liquidity (payment ratio of **1.03**).  

8. **Category Concentration Risk:**  
   Expense concentration is noticeable, with **36.2% of expenditures** allocated to travel. This introduces susceptibility to imbalanced spending during periods of financial stress.

#### **3. Financial Analysis**  

The applicant's financial metrics have been reviewed to determine their ability to manage the requested loan.  

- **Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio:**  
  Monthly debt obligations of **$200**, plus the proposed loan’s monthly installments, represent **9%** of the applicant’s monthly gross income (**$2,000**). This ratio is well below the industry standard of **36%**, indicating strong debt management capacity.  

- **Risk Score:**  
  The computed **risk score of 0.31** reflects moderate financial risk. This score accounts for factors such as declining savings trends and expense volatility. Comparable approved cases with similar profiles reinforce the viability of extending the loan under appropriately adjusted terms.  

- **Interest Rate:**  
  To address associated risks, the loan will be extended at an adjusted annual interest rate of **19%**, reflecting standard risk mitigation measures for applicants with similar profiles.  

- **Loan Installments:**  
  The monthly installment required to repay the loan has been calculated below:  
  - **Loan Amount:** $1,800  
  - **Interest Rate (Annual):** 19%  
  - **Loan Term:** 6 months  

Using the loan amortization formula:  
\[
M = \frac{P \cdot r \cdot (1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
\]  
Where:  
  \(M\) = Monthly installment  
  \(P\) = Loan principal  
  \(r\) = Monthly interest rate  
  \(n\) = Loan term (in months)  

**Calculation:**  
- Monthly interest rate = \(0.19 / 12 = 0.01583\)  
- Substituting into the formula:  
\[
M = \frac{1,800 \cdot 0.01583 \cdot (1 + 0.01583)^6}{(1 + 0.01583)^6 - 1}  
M = 315.09
\]  
**Monthly Installment:** $315.09

#### **4. Final Decision and Justification**  

**Final Decision:** **Accepted**  

**Justification:**  

Following extensive analysis, the loan application has been approved based on the following considerations:  

- **Stable income profile:** Reliable monthly earnings with low volatility support repayment potential.  
- **Manageable DTI ratio:** At 9%, the applicant’s debt obligations remain well within acceptable limits.  
- **Strong credit score:** A score of **700**, coupled with no delinquencies or bankruptcy, signifies responsible financial conduct.  

**Risk Mitigation Measures:**  
While the applicant’s **expense volatility** and **declining savings trends** pose notable risks, the following precautions have been taken:  
1. A **short-term repayment plan** of 6 months.  
2. An adjusted **interest rate** of 19% to compensate for moderate risk exposure.  

These measures align with previously approved cases (e.g., case IDs 128001010, 185000078, and 108001635), ensuring the loan structure sufficiently balances risk while meeting the applicant’s financial request.
