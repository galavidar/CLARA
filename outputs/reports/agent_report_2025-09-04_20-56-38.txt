**Risk and Financial Analysis**  
- **Credit Score:** 690 (moderate risk, above subprime threshold)  
- **Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio:** Following approval of the loan term adjustment (from 48 months to 36 months), the applicant’s new **monthly installment** will be calculated below. Combined with the existing monthly debt obligation of $1,000, the estimated DTI ratio remains manageable relative to income stability.  

- **Risk Score:** 0.9246 (indicating low-moderate risk exposure)  
- **Interest Rate:** 12.5% (fixed rate, risk-adjusted based on credit score and stability metrics)  

Calculation for monthly installments is detailed as follows:  
Loan Amount ($100,000) * [Interest Rate (12.5% annual)] / [Loan Term (36 months)]  

- **Monthly Installment (with Interest):**  
Using the **PMT formula** for loan amortization:  
\[ PMT = \frac{P \times r(1+r)^n}{(1+r)^n - 1} \]  
Where:  
P = Loan Principal ($100,000)  
r = Monthly interest rate (12.5% annual / 12 = 0.010417)  
n = Total number of payments (36 months)  

\[ PMT = \frac{100000 \times 0.010417(1+0.010417)^{36}}{(1+0.010417)^{36} - 1} = \text{\$3,354.27} \]  

**Estimated Monthly Payment:** $3,354.27

**Final Loan Decision**  
- **Decision:** **Accepted** (with adjusted loan term)  
- **Justification:**  
The applicant demonstrates several positive financial attributes that support the loan approval:  
  - Stable income with low variability (consistent earning capacity ensures repayment capabilities).  
  - Absence of delinquencies or bankruptcies bolsters creditworthiness.  
  - Moderate credit score (690), combined with disciplined saving habits and liquidity management (savings rate of 39.33% and absence of overdrafts).  

While risks such as declining financial trends (-6.28% income, +96.01% expenses) and spending category concentration do exist, these are mitigated through adjustments to loan terms, ensuring manageable monthly installments. Relevant historical cases ([228003472, 214003086, 96004968]) provide precedence for approving applicants with comparable credit scores, lower income, and higher DTI ratios under revised terms.

**Loan Adjustment Terms**  
- **Loan Amount:** $100,000  
- **Loan Term:** 36 months (revised from 48 months to mitigate risk exposure)  
- **Interest Rate:** 12.5% fixed  

**Monthly Installment:** $3,354.27  
**Total Loan Repayment:** $120,752.20  

---

**Recommendation**  
Approval is recommended with the adjusted loan term and installment schedule to align with risk mitigation policies while accommodating the applicant’s financial stability profile.
