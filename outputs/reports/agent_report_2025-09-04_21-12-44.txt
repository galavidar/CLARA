**Income, Debt, and Risk Metrics:**  
- **Annual Income:** $48,000 (monthly: $4,000)  
- **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):**  
  Monthly Debt Obligations: $250 (existing) + $711.62 (new loan).

**Monthly Installment Calculation:**  
Using the formula for amortized loans:  

\[
M = \dfrac{P \cdot r}{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}
\]

Where:  
- \(P = 23,000\) (loan amount)  
- \(r = \frac{0.0725}{12} = 0.006041666667\) (monthly interest rate)  
- \(n = 36\) (loan term in months)  

\[
M = \dfrac{23,000 \cdot 0.006041666667}{1 - (1 + 0.006041666667)^{-36}} = \$711.62  
\]

**Monthly Installment:** $711.62  

Total repayment over 36 months: **$25,618.32** (including $2,618.32 interest).
