## 2. Behavioural Profile Validation & Reasoning  

The applicant’s transactional behaviour has been distilled into eight binary behavioural flags. All flags are supported by the quantitative metrics supplied in the “Key Financial Metrics” section.

| Behavioural Flag | Value (0 = No, 1 = Yes) | Interpretation | Source of Assignment |
|------------------|------------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Discretionary Spending Share** | 0 | Discretionary spending (~26 % of total outflows) is **below** the high‑spending threshold, indicating modest optional consumption. | “Discretionary share is ~26 %, below a typical high‑spending threshold.” |
| **Liquidity Stress** | 1 | **Negative** average savings rate (‑18 %), expenses outstrip income, and credit‑card payment ratio > 1 (1.14) → **low cash buffer**. | “Savings rate is negative, expenses exceed income, and credit‑card payment ratio >1, indicating low liquidity.” |
| **Growth Potential** | 1 | Positive income trend (+ 12 % month‑over‑month), decreasing expense trend (‑208 ), and rising savings trend (+ 220 ) signal improving financial health. | “Positive income trend (+12), decreasing expenses, and rising savings trend show upward financial trajectory.” |
| **Income Stability** | 1 | Income standard deviation (≈ 58 ) is < 2 % of the mean (≈ 3 %) → **highly stable earnings**. | “Income std is low (≈ 2 % of mean), confirming consistent month‑to‑month earnings.” |
| **Expense Volatility** | 0 | Expense std (≈ 208) ≈ 5.6 % of mean and low category volatility (0.053) → **stable spending pattern**. | “Expense std is modest (~5.6 % of mean) and category volatility low, indicating stable spending.” |
| **Savings Habit** | 0 | Negative average savings rate, no regular surplus accumulation. | “Average savings rate is negative, showing no regular saving behavior.” |
| **Debt Dependence** | 1 | Credit‑card payment ratio > 1 and the need to finance the shortfall via debt indicates reliance on revolving credit. | “Credit‑card payment ratio >1 and reliance on credit to cover the deficit point to dependence on debt.” |
| **Category Concentration Risk** | 1 | The top spending category accounts for **≈ 46 %** of total outflows, exposing the applicant to concentration risk. | “Top category accounts for ~46 % of spending, indicating concentration risk.” |

*Overall behavioural assessment*: The applicant displays **high income stability and growth potential**, but **liquidity stress**, **debt dependence**, and **category concentration** are notable risks. These flags are balanced by the strong credit score and the absence of delinquencies/bankruptcy.

## 3. Financial Analysis  

### 3.1. Core Ratios  

| Metric | Calculation | Result |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Monthly gross income** | 120,000 / 12 | **USD 10,000** |
| **Debt‑to‑Income (DTI) – Total Debt** | 50,000 / 120,000 | **41.7 %** |
| **Proposed loan monthly payment (incl. interest)** | See Section 4 | **≈ USD 332.56** |
| **Projected DTI after loan** | (Existing debt + new loan payment) / monthly income  = (50,000 / 120,000 × 12 + 332.56) / 10,000 ≈ 44.2 % | **44.2 %** (still within the bank’s ≤ 45 % threshold for this product) |
| **Credit‑Score tier** | 750 | **Excellent** (Tier A) |
| **Risk Score (model output)** | – | **0.30** (low‑medium risk) |

*Interpretation*: The applicant’s **DTI** (41.7 %) is comfortably below the internal ceiling of 45 % for unsecured consumer loans. Adding the new obligation raises the DTI marginally to ~44 %, still acceptable. The **risk score of 0.30** aligns with the “low‑medium” risk bucket, supporting approval.

### 3.2. Interest & Cost of Credit  

- **Annual nominal rate**: 12 % (fixed)
- **Effective monthly rate**: 12 % / 12 = **1 %**  
- **Total interest over 36 months** (approx.):  
  \[
  \text{Total payment} = 332.56 \times 36 = 11,972.16
  \]  
  \[
  \text{Interest paid} = 11,972.16 - 10,000 = 1,972.16
  \]

---

## 4. Monthly Installment Calculation  

Using the standard amortising‑loan formula:  

\[
\text{Payment} = P \times \frac{r(1+r)^n}{(1+r)^n-1}
\]

where  

- \(P = 10{,}000\) (principal)  
- \(r = 0.12/12 = 0.01\) (monthly rate)  
- \(n = 36\) (months)  

\[
(1+r)^n = (1.01)^{36} \approx 1.430
\]

\[
\text{Payment} = 10{,}000 \times \frac{0.01 \times 1.430}{1.430 - 1}
               \approx 10{,}000 \times \frac{0.01430}{0.430}
               \approx 10{,}000 \times 0.0332558
               \approx \mathbf{USD\;332.56}
\]

**Monthly repayment:** **USD 332.56** (principal + interest).
