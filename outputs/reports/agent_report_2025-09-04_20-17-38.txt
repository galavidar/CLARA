### 1. Applicant Request Summary  

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Applicant Occupation** | Doctor (10 years tenure) |
| **Home Status** | Own |
| **Annual Income** | **US $120,000** (≈ US $10,000 / mo) |
| **Requested Loan Amount** | **US $10,000** |
| **Loan Term** | **36 months** |
| **Purpose** | Purchase of a car |

### 2. Behavioural Profile Validation  

The behavioural engine produced eight‑bit binary flags. “1” denotes a risk‑relevant characteristic; “0” denotes the absence of the condition.

| Profile Flag | Value | Interpretation (derived from supplied reasons) |
|--------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Discretionary Spending Share** | 0 | Discretionary spend (≈ 26 %) is below the high‑spending threshold – not a concern. |
| **Liquidity Stress** | **1** | Negative average savings rate (‑18 %) and expenses > income indicate no liquid buffer despite zero overdrafts. |
| **Growth Potential** | **1** | Positive income trend (+$12.10 /mo) and falling expenses (‑$207.86 /mo) signal improving cash flow. |
| **Income Stability** | **1** | Low income volatility (σ ≈ $58 on a mean of $3,121) – earnings are consistent. |
| **Expense Volatility** | 0 | Moderate expense std (≈ $208) and low category volatility (0.053) – spending pattern is stable. |
| **Savings Habit** | 0 | Average savings rate is negative; the applicant does not habitually set‑aside surplus. |
| **Debt Dependence** | **1** | Credit‑card payment ratio > 1 (1.14) and a monthly debt service of $50 k indicate reliance on debt to bridge cash‑flow gaps. |
| **Category Concentration Risk** | **1** | Top spending category consumes ~46 % of total outflows – concentration risk present. |

**Key behavioural take‑aways**  

* Liquidity stress and debt dependence are the dominant risk drivers.  
* Although income is stable and trending upward, the applicant’s cash‑flow cushion is effectively non‑existent.

### 3. Financial Analysis  

| Metric | Calculation | Result |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Monthly Gross Income** | 120,000 / 12 | **$10,000** |
| **Debt‑to‑Income (DTI) Ratio** | Monthly Debt / Monthly Income | **$50,000 / $10,000 = 5.0 → 500 %** |
| **Annual Interest Rate (model)** | – | **10.849 %** |
| **Monthly Interest Rate** | 10.849 % ÷ = 0.10849 / 12 | **0.009041 (0.904 % per month)** |
| **Loan Amount** | – | **$10,000** |
| **Loan Term** | – | **36 months** |
| **Monthly Installment (PMT)** | \(P \times r /[1-(1+r)^{-n}]\) | **≈ $326.20** |
| **Total Repayment** | PMT × n | **≈ $11,743.20** |
| **Total Interest Paid** | Total – Principal | **≈ $1,743.20** |
| **Risk Score (model output)** | – | **0.4881** (mid‑range) |

**Interpretation**  

* The **DTI of 500 %** is dramatically above the institution’s acceptable threshold (generally ≤ 35 %).  
* Monthly debt service ($50 k) alone exceeds the applicant’s entire monthly earnings, leaving no capacity to meet the additional $326 loan payment.  
* Despite an excellent credit score, the cash‑flow picture is untenable.

### 4. Risk Metrics  

| Metric | Value | Comment |
|--------|------|----------|
| **Credit Score** | 750 | Very good – mitigates credit‑risk but not sufficient alone. |
| **Behavioural Risk Flags** | Liquidity Stress, Debt Dependence, Category Concentration | High‑weight adverse signals. |
| **Model‑Generated Risk Score** | 0.4881 | Indicates moderate‑to‑high risk when combined with behavioural flags. |
| **Comparative Benchmark** | Accepted case 46001148 DTI = 30.95 % ; Physician case 185001419 DTI ≈ 5.32 % (interest 5.32 %) | Applicant’s DTI is an order of magnitude higher. |

### 5. Repayment Capacity & Stress Test  

| Scenario | Net Cash Flow (Income – Debt – Loan PMT) |
|----------|----------------------------------------|
| **Current** | $10,000 – $50,000 – $326 = **‑$40,326** |
| **Best‑case (optimistic 20 % income increase)** | $12,000 – $50,000 – $326 → ‑$38,326 |
| **Stress (10 % expense reduction, no income change)** | $10,000 – $45,000 – $326 → ‑$35,326 |

All scenarios remain deeply negative, confirming inability to service the additional loan.

### 6. Monthly Installment Calculation (Detail)

\[
\begin{aligned}
r_{m} &= \frac{0.1084924214}{12}=0.0090410335\\[4pt]
PMT &= \frac{10{,}000 \times 0.0090410335}{1-(1+0.0090410335)^{-36}}\\[4pt]
    &\approx \frac{90.410335}{0.2773}\\[4pt]
    &\approx \mathbf{US\; \$326.20\; per\; month}
\end{aligned}
\]

*Total repayment over 36 months = 36 × $326.20 ≈ $11,743.20.*

### 7. Decision & Motivation  

| Decision | Rejected |
|----------|----------|
| **Primary Reason** | **Severe liquidity stress (negative savings rate) combined with extreme debt‑to‑income ratio (500 %).** |
| **Supporting Evidence** | • Behavioural flags: Liquidity Stress = 1, Debt Dependence = 1, Category Concentration = 1. <br>• Financial metrics: Monthly debt ($50 k) > monthly income ($10 k); DTI far exceeds any approved precedent. <br>• Risk score 0.4881, while moderate, is outweighed by cash‑flow insufficiency. |
| **Secondary Considerations** | • Credit score is strong, but underwriting policy prioritises repayment capacity over score alone. <br>• No delinquencies or bankruptcy, yet the cash‑flow gap precludes any realistic repayment schedule. |
| **Outcome** | The loan request **cannot be funded**. The applicant should be advised to address the debt burden and improve liquidity before re‑applying. |
