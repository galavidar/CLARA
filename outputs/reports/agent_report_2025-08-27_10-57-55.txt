### 2. Behavioural Profile Validation & Rationale  

| Behavioural flag | Assigned value | Interpretation (derived from metrics) | Decision impact |
|------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Discretionary‑spending‑share** | **0** (not high) | Discretionary share ≈ 26 % – within normal range for a professional with non‑essential expenses. | Neutral |
| **Liquidity‑stress** | **1** (present) | Negative average savings rate (‑18 %) and expenses exceed income (mean expense ≈ USD 3,686 vs income ≈ USD 3,121). No overdrafts, but cash‑flow cushion is thin. | Slightly adverse – mitigated by strong income. |
| **Growth‑potential** | **1** (present) | Positive income trend (+USD 12 monthly) and savings trend (+USD 220 monthly) together with decreasing expense trend (‑USD 208 monthly) signal improving financial footing. | Positive |
| **Income‑stability** | **1** (present) | Income mean stable (σ ≈ 57 , CV ≈ 1.8 %). | Positive |
| **Expense‑volatility** | **0** (absent) | Expense CV ≈ 5.6 % and low category volatility (≈ 5.3 %). Spending pattern is predictable. | Positive |
| **Savings‑habit** | **0** (absent) | Average savings rate negative; no systematic savings behaviour observed. | Slightly adverse |
| **Debt‑dependence** | **0** (absent) | Credit‑card payment ratio > 1 shows balances are being paid off each cycle; debt load is manageable relative to income. | Positive |
| **Category‑concentration‑risk** | **1** (present) | Top spending category accounts for ~46 % of total outflows, indicating concentration risk (e.g., medical‑related expenses). | Neutral‑to‑adverse |

**Overall behavioural assessment:**  
The applicant exhibits a **solid income base, strong credit discipline, and clear upward financial trends**. Liquidity stress and lack of a regular savings habit are the only modest concerns, but they are outweighed by high income stability and positive cash‑flow trends. The behavioural profile is therefore **acceptable for approval**.

### 3. Financial Analysis  

| Metric | Calculation / Value |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Interest rate (annual)** | 12 % (fixed) |
| **Monthly interest rate** | 12 % ÷ 12 = 1.00 % (0.0100) |
| **Monthly payment (PMT)** | \( \displaystyle PMT = \frac{P \times r}{1-(1+r)^{-n}} \)  <br> \( = \frac{10{,}000 \times 0.0100}{1-(1.0100)^{-36}} \) <br> **≈ USD 333.22** |
| **Total interest over term** | \(333.22 \times 36 - 10{,}000 \approx 1{,}196\) |
| **Debt‑to‑Income (DTI) – total debt** | \( \frac{50{,}000}{120{,}000}=0.4167\) → **41.7 %** (within typical underwriting ceiling of 45 % for professional borrowers) |
| **DTI – incorporating new loan payment** | Monthly debt service unknown; using only the new loan: \( \frac{333.22}{10{,}000}=0.0333\) → **3.3 %** of monthly income |
| **Risk score (model)** | **0.30** – indicates low‑to‑moderate risk (threshold for approval set at ≤ 0.35) |
| **Credit score** | **750** – excellent (FICO “Excellent” band) |
| **Liquidity cushion** | Negative savings rate (‑18 %); however, no overdraft incidents in the last 12 months. |

**Conclusion of financial analysis:**  
All quantitative indicators are comfortably within the bank’s underwriting limits. The DTI ratio is moderate, the credit score is strong, and the model‑generated risk score is well below the approval threshold. The modest liquidity stress is offset by the applicant’s high, stable income and positive cash‑flow trends.

### 4. Final Decision & Motivation  

**Decision:** **APPROVED**  

**Approved terms:**  

- **Loan amount:** USD 10,000  
- **Term:** 36 months (fixed)  
- **Interest rate:** 12 % p.a. (fixed)  
- **Monthly repayment:** **USD 333.22** (principal + interest)  

**Motivation:**  

1. **Creditworthiness:** Credit score of 750, clean delinquency record, and no bankruptcy.  
2. **Income stability and growth:** Ten‑year tenure as a doctor, 10 years of home ownership, and a highly stable, upward‑trending income stream.  
3. **Risk model alignment:** Risk score of 0.30 (well under the 0.35 approval cut‑off) and 7 analogous historic cases approved with zero defaults.  
4. **Debt metrics:** Total debt‑to‑income ratio of 41.7 % (acceptable for this segment) and a modest additional DTI impact of 3.3 % from the new loan.  
5. **Behavioural profile:** Positive growth potential, income stability, low expense volatility, and responsible credit‑card utilisation outweigh the limited liquidity stress.  

Given the strong overall profile, the loan is **approved** with the standard rate of 12 % for the requested term.

### 5. Monthly Installment Calculation (Verification)

\[
\begin{aligned}
r_{\text{monthly}} &= \frac{0.12}{12}=0.0100\\
n &= 36\\[4pt]
PMT &= \frac{10{,}000 \times 0.0100}{1-(1+0.0100)^{-36}}\\
    &\approx \frac{100}{1- (1.0100)^{-36}}\\
    &\approx \frac{100}{0.300} \\
    &\approx \mathbf{USD\;333.22}
\end{aligned}
\]

*Total repayment over 36 months:* **USD 12,195.92** (principal + interest).
