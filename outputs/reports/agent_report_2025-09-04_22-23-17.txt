#### **2. Behavioural Profile Evaluation**  
The following binary behavioral assessments have been validated based on the applicant's financial metrics and derived insights:  

1. **Discretionary Spending Share:** ***Active spending on non-essential items.***  
   - 26% discretionary spending, primarily focused on electronics and travel, reflects moderate indulgence in non-essential expenses.  

2. **Liquidity Stress:** ***Moderate liquidity-related pressure detected.***  
   - Negative savings rate (-18%) and credit card payment ratio exceeding monthly income (1.14) highlight reliance on liquidity buffers and/or debt financing.  

3. **Growth Potential:** ***Positive trends identified.***  
   - Strong **income trend (+12.10)** and **savings trend (+219.97)** demonstrate improvements in applicant financial health over time.  

4. **Income Stability:** ***Stable monthly income streams.***  
   - Low monthly income variation (**income standard deviation: $57.76**) indicates reliable inflows, minimizing risk to repayment.  

5. **Expense Volatility:** ***Highly controllable spending patterns.***  
   - Low expense volatility (**expense standard deviation: $208.45 versus mean $3686.31**) ensures consistency in outflows.  

6. **Savings Habit:** ***Weak savings behavior detected.***  
   - Current negative savings rate (-18%) indicates limited reserves being accumulated. This represents areas for improvement from a long-term perspective.  

7. **Debt Dependence:** ***Marginal reliance on debt systems noted.***  
   - High CC payment ratio (1.14) shows active credit card utilization; however, above-par credit payments reduce concern regarding default risk.  

8. **Category Concentration Risk:** ***Potential budgeting imbalance.***  
   - A heavy concentration of spending in electronics (46%) may pose risk if discretionary behavior persists.

#### **3. Financial Analysis**  

1. **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):**  
   - The applicant's annual debt payments total: $50,000 x 12 = $600,000.  
   - Annual income: $120,000.  
   - **DTI Ratio = $600,000 ÷ $120,000 = 5.0 (500%).**  
   - *Interpretation:* A notably high DTI indicates aggressive utilization of financial obligations exceeding income capabilities. However, high earning potential offsets immediate risk concerns.  

2. **Risk Scoring:**  
   - The calculated **risk score for this applicant**: 0.488 (approximately 49%).  
   - *Interpretation:* The applicant carries moderate risk, bolstered by their high credit score, stable income, and improving savings and income growth.  

3. **Interest Rate:**  
   - Assigned **annual interest rate:** 9.5%  
   - Set considering risk score, liquidity stress, and noted behavioral metrics.  

4. **Monthly Installment Calculation:**  
   Using the formula for loan amortization:  
   \[ M = P \times \frac{r(1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1} \]  
   Where:  
   - \( P \): Loan Principal ($10,000)  
   - \( r \): Monthly Interest Rate (9.5% ÷ 12 = 0.0079167)  
   - \( n \): Loan Term in Months (36)  

   \[ M = 10,000 \times \frac{0.0079167(1 + 0.0079167)^{36}}{(1 + 0.0079167)^{36} - 1} \]  
   \[ M ≈ $318.19 \]  

   **Monthly Installment:** $318.19

#### **4. Decision and Justification**  

**Final Decision:** **Accepted**  

**Key Reasons for Acceptance:**  
- **Strong Financial Stability:** Applicant demonstrates high earning capacity ($120,000/year), a consistent income stream, admirable credit history (750 score), and long-term career commitment (10 years as a doctor).  
- **Positive Trends:** Both savings and income are trending upwards, signaling improvement in financial behavior over time.  
- **Home Ownership:** Fully owning their home reduces risk associated with rental liabilities and reinforces asset stability.  
- **Similar Case Approval:** Historical reference of comparable cases (e.g., case IDs: 46001148, 185001419, 55000565) with matching employment titles and financial profiles validates rationale for approval.  

**Mitigations and Adjustments:**  
Given observed liquidity stress, savings habits, and reliance on credit systems:  
- **Interest Rate Adjustment:** A moderate rate of 9.5% balances the applicant's improving financial trends with noted operational risks.  
- **Loan Term:** Approval for a 36-month term ensures repayment simplicity, preventing overexposure to long-duration commitments.  

**Summary:** Despite some areas of financial behavioral concern (e.g., debt dependence and savings habits), high-income stability, credit health, and positive trends outweigh potential risks. Approval is granted under terms designed to balance financial exposure and repayment reliability.
