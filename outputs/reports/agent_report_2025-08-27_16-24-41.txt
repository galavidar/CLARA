## 2. Behavioural Profile Assessment  

The behavioural engine has generated a binary profile for eight key risk dimensions. The rationale for each assignment is provided below.

| Dimension | Assigned Value | Interpretation | Supporting Reasoning |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Discretionary Spending Share** | **0** | Within acceptable limits (≈ 26 % of total spend). | “Discretionary share is ~26 %, which is not markedly high relative to typical thresholds.” |
| **Liquidity Stress** | **1** | Mild liquidity pressure. | “No overdrafts but credit‑card payment ratio > 1 and negative savings rate indicate limited liquidity.” |
| **Growth Potential** | **1** | Positive trajectory. | “Income rising (+12 %), expenses falling (‑208), savings increasing (+220) – shows growth.” |
| **Income Stability** | **1** | Highly stable earnings. | “Income std‑dev ≈ 2 % of mean → stable month‑to‑month income.” |
| **Expense Volatility** | **0** | Low variability. | “Expense std‑dev ≈ 5.6 % of mean → low volatility.” |
| **Savings Habit** | **0** | Weak saving behaviour. | “Average savings rate is negative (‑18 %) – no consistent saving.” |
| **Debt Dependence** | **1** | Reliance on credit lines. | “Credit‑card payment ratio exceeds 1, suggesting reliance on revolving credit.” |
| **Category Concentration Risk** | **1** | High concentration in a single spend category. | “Top category accounts for ~46 % of spending.” |

**Overall behavioural outlook:**  
- **Strengths:** Strong income stability, clear upward income trend, low expense volatility, and a solid credit score.  
- **Weaknesses:** Limited liquidity (negative savings rate, high credit‑card utilization) and a concentrated spending pattern, both of which raise the probability of cash‑flow strain under adverse conditions.  

The composite behavioural assessment aligns with a **moderate‑to‑high risk** profile, which is reflected in the quantitative risk score (0.30).

## 3. Financial Analysis  

### 3.1. Debt‑to‑Income (DTI) Ratio  

\[
\text{DTI} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Annual Income}} = \frac{50{,}000}{120{,}000}=0.4167 \; (\text{41.7 %})
\]

A DTI of **41.7 %** sits within the bank’s acceptable range for professional borrowers (≤ 45 % for high‑credit‑score individuals) but indicates a moderate debt load.  

### 3.2. Interest Rate & Risk Pricing  

- **Annual nominal rate:** **12 %** (as per product pricing).  
- **Monthly rate (r):** 0.12 / 12 = 0.01 (1 %).  

The rate reflects the applicant’s strong credit score (750) and professional stability, offset by the behavioural liquidity stress and concentration risk.  

### 3.3. Monthly Installment Calculation  

Using the standard amortising loan formula:

\[
\text{PMT} = P \times \frac{r(1+r)^n}{(1+r)^n-1}
\]

where  

- \(P = 10{,}000\) (principal)  
- \(r = 0.01\) (monthly rate)  
- \(n = 36\) (months)  

\[
(1+r)^n = (1.01)^{36} \approx 1.430
\]

\[
\text{PMT}=10{,}000 \times \frac{0.01 \times 1.430}{1.430-1}
          =10{,}000 \times \frac{0.01430}{0.430}
          \approx 10{,}000 \times 0.033256
          \approx \mathbf{USD\;332.56}
\]

**Monthly repayment:** **USD 332.56** (principal + interest).  

### 3.4. Risk Score  

- **Model‑generated score:** **0.30** (scale 0 = lowest risk, 1 = highest).  
- The score is consistent with the behavioural flags and the DTI ratio; it falls within the bank’s approved‑range threshold for this product (≤ 0.35).

## 4. Decision & Rationale  

| Decision | Approved |
|----------|----------|
| **Approved amount** | USD 10,000 |
| **Term** | 36 months |
| **Interest rate** | 12 % (annual) |
| **Monthly payment** | USD 332.56 |
| **Risk score** | 0.30 |
| **Justification** | The applicant’s high credit score, stable and rising income, and low expense volatility demonstrate strong repayment capacity. The loan request aligns with precedent: **seven similar historical cases in the database were approved and showed zero defaults**, providing empirical confidence. The moderate DTI (41.7 %) and the 12 % pricing adequately compensate for identified behavioural concerns (liquidity stress, debt dependence, and spending concentration). Consequently, the loan meets the bank’s risk‑adjusted underwriting criteria. |

**Final recommendation:** Proceed with disbursement under the outlined terms. Continuous monitoring of the applicant’s liquidity metrics (especially credit‑card utilization) is advised throughout the loan tenure.
