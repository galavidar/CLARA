## 2. Behavioural Profile Validation  

The applicant’s transaction‑derived behavioural indicators have been cross‑checked against the bank’s rule‑base. The binary flags and the rationale for each are listed below.

| Behavioural Flag | Value (0 = No, 1 = Yes) | Interpretation & Supporting Evidence |
|------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Discretionary‑spending‑share** | 0 | Discretionary spend ≈ 26 % of total outflow – below the 30 % threshold; therefore not a risk driver. |
| **Liquidity‑stress** | 1 | Savings rate is negative (‑18 %); monthly expenses (USD 3,686) exceed income (USD 3,121), indicating current cash‑flow pressure despite zero overdraft incidents. |
| **Growth‑potential** | 1 | Positive trends: income rising (+USD 12.1 / mo), expenses falling (‑USD 207.9 / mo), and savings improving (+USD 220 / mo). |
| **Income‑stability** | 1 | Income standard deviation is only 1.85 % of the mean, confirming highly stable earnings. |
| **Expense‑volatility** | 0 | Expense SD is ≈ 5 % of mean and category‑volatility is low (0.053). No flag. |
| **Savings‑habit** | 0 | Average savings rate is negative; the applicant consistently overspends relative to income. |
| **Debt‑dependence** | 1 | Credit‑card payment‑to‑income ratio > 1 (1.14) together with negative savings underscores reliance on revolving credit. |
| **Category‑concentration‑risk** | 1 | One spending category accounts for ~46 % of total outflows, indicating a concentration risk (e.g., large medical or professional expense). |

**Overall behavioural assessment** – The profile presents mixed signals: strong income stability and growth potential are offset by liquidity stress, a high debt‑dependence flag, and category‑concentration risk. The net behavioural risk is therefore **moderate**.

## 3. Financial Analysis  

| Metric | Calculation | Result |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Debt‑to‑Income (DTI) Ratio** | Total debt / Annual income = 50,000 / 120,000 | **41.7 %** |
| **Monthly Gross Income** | 120,000 / 12 | **USD 10,000** |
| **Proposed Monthly Repayment (incl. interest)** | \(P \times r(1+r)^n /[(1+r)^n-1]\)  where *P* = 10,000, *r* = 0.12/12 = 0.01, *n* = 36 months | **USD 332.56** |
| **Effective Annual Percentage Rate (APR)** | Stated rate | **12 %** |
| **Risk Score (Model output)** | – | **0.30** (scale 0 = low, 1 = high) |
| **Credit Score Band** | 750 → Excellent | **Excellent** |
| **Liquidity Cushion (post‑loan)** | Monthly net cash after loan = 10,000 – 3,686 – 332.56 ≈ USD 5,981 | Positive, but note existing negative savings trend. |

**Interpretation** – The applicant’s DTI of 41.7 % is within the bank’s acceptable range for prime‑rated borrowers (≤ 45 %). The projected monthly service (USD 332.56) represents **3.3 %** of gross monthly income, well below the typical 10 % threshold for sustainable repayment capacity. The risk score of **0.30** aligns with the “approved” segment in the model’s calibration.

## 4. Decision Rationale  

- **Model‑driven justification** – The loan request mirrors **7** historically similar profiles in the decision‑support database that were **approved** and **did not default**. The quantitative risk score (0.30) sits comfortably within the approved zone.
- **Credit quality** – Excellent credit score (750) and a 10‑year tenure in a high‑earning, high‑stability profession (Doctor) strongly support repayment ability.
- **Cash‑flow capacity** – Despite current liquidity stress, the net cash‑flow after loan service remains robust (> USD 5,900 / month). The applicant’s income trajectory is positive, with declining expenses and improving savings trends.
- **Risk mitigants** – Home ownership, a long employment record, and a relatively short loan horizon (3 years) limit exposure.
- **Flagged concerns** – Liquidity stress, debt dependence, and expense concentration are noted; however, they are outweighed by the positive income dynamics and low overall risk score.

**Decision:** **APPROVED**  

- **Approved amount:** USD 10,000  
- **Interest rate:** 12 % (fixed)  
- **Term:** 36 months  
- **Monthly repayment:** **USD 332.56**  
- **Risk score:** 0.30  

The loan will be funded under the standard prime‑rate product with quarterly monitoring of the borrower’s cash‑flow and debt‑service metrics.

## 5. Loan Servicing Calculations  

**Amortisation Formula**  

\[
\text{PMT}= \frac{P \times r \times (1+r)^{n}}{(1+r)^{n}-1}
\]

- **P** = 10,000 USD  
- **r** = 0.12 / 12 = 0.01 (monthly)  
- **n** = 36 months  

\[
\text{PMT}= \frac{10{,}000 \times 0.01 \times (1.01)^{36}}{(1.01)^{36}-1}
        = \frac{143.0}{0.430}
        \approx \mathbf{332.56\;USD}
\]

**Total interest paid over the life of the loan:**  

\[
\text{Total payment}=332.56 \times 36 = 11{,}971.99\; \text{USD}
\]
\[
\text{Interest}=11{,}971.99 - 10{,}000 = 1{,}971.99\; \text{USD}
\]

## 6. Monitoring & Conditions  

1. **Monthly statements** – Verify that the borrower maintains the scheduled payment of USD 332.56.  
2. **Quarterly review** – Re‑assess liquidity metrics (savings rate, expense concentration) and DTI.  
3. **Early repayment** – No pre‑payment penalty; borrower may refinance if liquidity improves.  
4. **Flag escalation** – Trigger alerts if the applicant’s savings rate remains negative for two consecutive quarters or if the credit‑card payment ratio exceeds 1.2.
