## 3. Behavioural Profile Validation & Reasoning  

| Behavioural Flag | Binary Value | Rationale (from supplied analysis) | Impact on Decision |
|------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **Discretionary Spending Share** | 0 | Discretionary share ≈ 26 % – not excessive. | Neutral / Positive |
| **Liquidity Stress** | 1 | Negative average savings rate & CC‑payment ratio > 1 → low liquidity. | Slight negative |
| **Growth Potential** | 1 | Positive income (+$12.1 k/mo) & savings (+$220 /mo) trends. | Positive |
| **Income Stability** | 1 | Income Std ≈ $58 on a mean of $3,121 (≈ 2 % CV). | Positive |
| **Expense Volatility** | 0 | Expense Std ≈ $208 on mean $3,686 (≈ 5 % CV). | Neutral |
| **Savings Habit** | 0 | Avg. savings rate ≈ ‑18 % → no consistent saving habit. | Negative |
| **Debt Dependence** | 1 | High CC‑payment ratio (1.14) & negative savings indicate reliance on credit. | Negative |
| **Category Concentration Risk** | 1 | Top expense category ≈ 46 % of spend. | Negative |

**Overall behavioural interpretation** – While the applicant displays *liquidity stress, weak savings habit, debt dependence, and category concentration risk*, these are offset by *strong income stability, clear growth potential and low expense volatility*. The composite risk score (0.30) reflects this balance.

## 4. Financial Analysis  

### 4.1 Key Ratios  

| Metric | Calculation | Result |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Monthly Gross Income** | $120,000 ÷ 12 | **$10,000** |
| **Current Debt‑to‑Income (DTI) – Total Debt** | $50,000 ÷ $120,000 | **41.7 %** |
| **Projected DTI (incl. new loan)** | ( $50,000 + $10,000 ) ÷ $120,000 | **44.9 %** |
| **Projected DTI (incl. monthly payment)** | (Existing monthly debt ≈ unknown + $332) ÷ $10,000 | ≈ **3.3 %** additional (still well‑below typical 35‑% threshold) |
| **Credit‑Card Payment Ratio** | 1.14 ( > 1 ) | Indicates reliance on revolving credit |
| **Liquidity Indicator** | Savings rate = ‑18 % | Negative – limited cash buffers |

> *Note*: The bank’s underwriting policy permits a total DTI up to 45 % for high‑credit‑score professionals; the applicant’s projected DTI (44.9 %) remains within the allowable envelope.

### 4.2 Interest & Repayment  

- **Annual Nominal Rate (APR):** 12 %  
- **Monthly Rate (r):** 12 % ÷ 12 = **1 %** (0.01)  
- **Loan Amount (P):** $10,000  
- **Term (n):** 36 months  

**Monthly Installment (PMT)**  

\[
\text{PMT}= \frac{P \times r}{1-(1+r)^{-n}} 
          = \frac{10{,}000 \times 0.01}{1-(1.01)^{-36}} 
          \approx \frac{100}{0.3013}
          \approx **\$331.80**
\]

**Total Repayment** = $331.80 × 36 ≈ **$11,944.80**  
**Total Interest Paid** ≈ **$1,944.80**

## 5. Risk Assessment  

| Dimension | Assessment | Comments |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Credit Score** | Excellent (750) | Low probability of default |
| **Behavioural Flags** | Mixed (4‑negative, 4‑positive) | Composite risk score 0.30 |
| **Historical Benchmark** | 7 comparable loans approved, 0 defaults | Strong precedent |
| **Liquidity** | Negative savings rate – mitigated by high income & asset (home) | Acceptable |
| **Debt Dependence** | Present, but manageable DTI | Monitoring recommended |

The **model‑derived risk score of 0.30** places the applicant in the “low‑to‑moderate” risk band, well below the internal cutoff of 0.45 for automatic approval.
