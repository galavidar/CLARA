Behavioural Profile Validation  \n\n| Profile Flag | Binary Indicator | Rationale (as supplied) | Assessment |\n|--------------|------------------|------------------------|------------|\n| **Discretionary Spending Share** | 1 | Discretionary share \u2248\u202f26\u202f% (relatively high). | **Attention** \u2013 non\u2011essential spend is elevated. |\n| **Liquidity Stress** | 1 | Negative average savings rate (\u201118\u202f%) and no overdrafts \u21d2 limited liquid reserves. | **Attention** \u2013 low cushion for unexpected cash\u2011flow shocks. |\n| **Growth Potential** | 1 | Income trending up (+$12\u202f/\u202fmo), expenses falling (\u2011$208\u202f/\u202fmo), savings improving (+$220\u202f/\u202fmo). | **Positive** \u2013 strong upward momentum. |\n| **Income Stability** | 1 | Income SD\u202f=\u202f$57.8 (\u2248\u202f1.8\u202f% of mean) \u2013 very stable month\u2011to\u2011month earnings. | **Positive** \u2013 reliable cash\u2011flow source. |\n| **Expense Volatility** | 0 | Expense SD\u202f\u2248\u202f5.6\u202f% of mean and low category volatility \u2013 spending is not highly volatile. | **Neutral/Positive** \u2013 predictable expense pattern. |\n| **Savings Habit** | 0 | Average savings rate \u201318\u202f% (negative) \u2013 applicant does not regularly save. | **Concern** \u2013 potential reliance on credit. |\n| **Debt Dependence** | 1 | Credit\u2011card payment ratio\u202f=\u202f1.14 (>\u202f1) and negative savings indicate reliance on revolving credit. | **Attention** \u2013 higher sensitivity to additional debt. |\n| **Category Concentration Risk** | 1 | Top spending category accounts for 46\u202f% of total spend \u2013 high concentration risk. | **Attention** \u2013 limited diversification of expense categories. |\n\n**Overall Behavioural Interpretation**  \nThe applicant exhibits strong **income stability** and **growth potential**, which offset several risk flags (high discretionary spend, liquidity stress, debt dependence, and category concentration). The **risk score of 0.30** (on a 0\u20111 scale) reflects this balanced view.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Financial Analysis  \n\n| Metric | Calculation | Result |\n|--------|-------------|--------|\n| **Monthly Gross Income** | $120,000\u202f\u00f7\u202f12 | **$10,000** |\n| **Proposed Monthly Installment** | PMT = P\u202f\u00d7\u202fr(1+r)^n / [(1+r)^n\u202f\u2013\u202f1] <br>r\u202f=\u202f0.12/12\u202f=\u202f0.01, n\u202f=\u202f36, P\u202f=\u202f$10,000 | **$332.56** |\n| **Debt\u2011to\u2011Income (DTI) Ratio \u2013 Existing Debt** | $50,000\u202f\u00f7\u202f$120,000 | **41.7\u202f%** |\n| **DTI Ratio \u2013 Including New Loan** | ($50,000\u202f+\u202f$10,000)\u202f\u00f7\u202f$120,000 | **50.0\u202f%** |\n| **Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)** | Monthly Income \u00f7 (Existing Monthly Debt Payments + New Loan Payment) * (approx.) | Not directly supplied; however, the new payment consumes **3.3\u202f%** of gross monthly income, leaving ample headroom given the applicant\u2019s stable earnings. |\n| **Interest Rate** | Fixed annual rate supplied | **12\u202f%** |\n| **Risk Score** | Model output | **0.30** (low\u2011to\u2011moderate) |\n| **Credit Score** | Supplied | **750** (excellent) |\n\n**Interpretation**  \n- The **DTI of 50\u202f%** remains within the bank\u2019s acceptable threshold for professional borrowers (\u2264\u202f55\u202f%).  \n- The **monthly loan payment ($332.56)** represents **3.3\u202f%** of gross monthly income, well below typical affordability caps (\u2264\u202f10\u202f%).  \n- The high credit score and strong income stability further mitigate the elevated discretionary and liquidity flags.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Loan Terms & Repayment Schedule  \n\n| Component | Detail |\n|-----------|--------|\n| **Principal** | $10,000 |\n| **Annual Rate** | 12\u202f% (fixed) |\n| **Term** | 36\u202fmonths |\n| **Monthly Rate** | 1\u202f% |\n| **Monthly Installment (Principal + Interest)** | **$332.56** |\n| **Total Repayment (Principal + Interest)** | $332.56\u202f\u00d7\u202f36\u202f=\u202f$11,972.16 |\n| **Total Interest Charged** | $1,972.16 |\n\n---\n\n### 5. Decision & Justification  \n\n| Decision | Approved |\n|----------|----------|\n| **Interest Rate** | 12\u202f% (as proposed) |\n| **Term** | 36\u202fmonths |\n| **Risk Score** | 0.30 |\n| **Justification** | 1. The applicant\u2019s **high credit score (750)** and **stable, upward\u2011trending income** provide a solid repayment capacity. <br>2. The **DTI remains within policy limits**, and the **monthly installment consumes a modest 3.3\u202f%** of gross monthly income. <br>3. **Behavioural analysis** highlights growth potential and income stability that outweigh the identified concerns (high discretionary spend, liquidity stress, debt dependence). <br>4. The **risk score of 0.30** aligns with the bank\u2019s historical approval set \u2013 seven comparable cases in the database were approved and showed no default over the loan horizon. <br>5. No delinquencies or bankruptcy history are present. <br>**Conclusion:** The risk\u2011adjusted profile, combined with quantitative metrics, supports approval of the $10,000 vehicle loan under the stated terms. |\n\n---\n\n### 6.
