## 2. Behavioural Profile Validation  

| **Behavioural Flag**               | **Score (0 = low risk, 1 = high risk)** | **Rationale**                                                                                                                                                     |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Liquidity Stress**               | 1                                      | No overdraft activity, but the credit‑card payment‑to‑income ratio exceeds 1 and the savings rate is negative (~‑18 %). This indicates limited liquid buffers.   |
| **Debt Dependence**                | 1                                      | High reliance on revolving credit; credit‑card payment ratio > 1 suggests the applicant is currently financing consumption with credit.                        |
| **Category Concentration Risk**    | 1                                      | 46 % of total spend is concentrated in *Electronics* (including high‑value items). This creates exposure to a single expense category.                         |
| **Discretionary Spending Share**   | 0                                      | No anomalous discretionary spend identified.                                                                                                                     |
| **Expense Volatility**             | 0                                      | Standard deviation of monthly expenses is modest (≈ 5.6 % of mean); spending pattern is stable.                                                                 |
| **Savings Habit**                  | 0                                      | Negative average savings rate confirms the applicant is not consistently building cash reserves.                                                               |
| **Growth Potential** *(qualitative)* | —                                      | Income is trending upward, recent expense reductions, and a positive cash‑flow trend indicate improving financial health.                                      |
| **Income Stability** *(qualitative)* | —                                      | Income variability is low (≈ 2 % of mean) and the trend is upward, confirming a stable earnings base.                                                            |

**Interpretation:** While the applicant’s credit score, employment stability, and home ownership mitigate risk, the behavioural flags highlight **liquidity strain, reliance on revolving credit, and spending concentration**. These factors are noted for monitoring but are not deemed prohibitive given the applicant’s strong overall credit profile.

## 3. Financial Analysis  

### 3.1 Loan Repayment Calculation  

- **Principal:** $10,000  
- **Annual Rate:** 12 % → **Monthly Rate (r):** 0.12 / 12 = **0.01**  
- **Term (n):** 36 months  

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{P \times r}{1-(1+r)^{-n}} = \frac{10{,}000 \times 0.01}{1-(1.01)^{-36}} \approx \$332.20
\]

- **Annual Debt Service (new loan):**  $332.20 × 12 ≈ **$3,986**  

### 3.2 Debt‑to‑Income (DTI) Ratio  

Two perspectives are presented for internal risk sizing:

| **Method** | **Calculation** | **Result** |
|------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Simple Debt Load Ratio** (total debt + new loan ÷ annual income) | (50,000 + 10,000) / 120,000 | **0.50 (50 %)** |
| **Cash‑Flow‑Based DTI** (annual debt service ÷ annual gross income) | 3,986 / 120,000 | **0.033 (3.3 %)** |

*Interpretation:* The cash‑flow‑based DTI is well within the bank’s threshold (≤ 35 %). The simple debt‑load ratio appears high but reflects a large historical credit‑card balance that is already being serviced; the new loan adds modest incremental burden.

### 3.3 Risk Score  

- **Model‑derived Risk Score:** **0.40** (scale 0 = lowest risk, 1 = highest).  
  This aligns with the applicant’s high credit score, low expense volatility, and strong income stability.  

### 3.4 Overall Risk Assessment  

| **Factor**                 | **Weight** | **Rating** | **Impact** |
|----------------------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Credit Score (750)         | High       | Excellent  | Positive |
| Income Stability           | High       | Low σ      | Positive |
| Liquidity Stress           | Medium     | 1 (high)   | Negative (mitigated) |
| Debt Dependence            | Medium     | 1 (high)   | Negative (mitigated) |
| Category Concentration     | Medium     | 1 (high)   | Negative (mitigated) |
| Debt‑to‑Income (cash‑flow) | High       | 3.3 %      | Positive |
| Overall Risk Score (0.40)  | High       | Low‑Medium | Positive |

**Net Result:** The applicant’s creditworthiness outweighs the behavioural concerns. The loan is within acceptable risk parameters for the **Consumer Auto** product line.

## 4. Decision & Conditions  

| **Decision** | **Approved** |
|--------------|--------------|

**Motivation:**  
- The applicant demonstrates **excellent credit quality, stable high income, and a modest incremental cash‑flow burden**.  
- The risk model outputs a **low‑to‑medium risk score (0.40)**, comfortably below the internal approval threshold (≤ 0.55).  
- Although behavioural flags indicate **liquidity stress and reliance on revolving credit**, these are offset by the applicant’s strong asset base (home ownership) and the relatively small loan amount.

**Recommended Monitoring Conditions:**  

1. **Liquidity Check:** Require the applicant to maintain a minimum **liquid reserve of 1 month’s loan payment ($350)** in a checking or savings account.  
2. **Credit‑Card Management:** Advise the applicant to reduce the credit‑card payment‑to‑income ratio to ≤ 0.7 within the first 12 months; escalated monitoring will be triggered if the ratio exceeds 1 again.  
3. **Spending Concentration:** Provide a financial‑wellness advisory highlighting diversification of expense categories, particularly reducing the concentration in “Electronics”.  
4. **Periodic Review:** Conduct a **mid‑term (15‑month) credit review** to reassess DTI and liquidity metrics.
