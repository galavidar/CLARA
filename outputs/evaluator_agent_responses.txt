"{\n  \"action\": \"revise_terms\",\n  \"comments\": \"The behavioural profiles are largely consistent with the applicant data, though the discretionary_spending_share flag could be clarified (moderate spending was labelled as low risk). The loan approval aligns with a medium risk tolerance given the moderate risk score (0.4), but the applicant shows significant liquidity stress, high debt dependence, and a negative savings rate despite a good credit score and stable income. To better match the risk profile, the loan terms should be adjusted—e.g., increase the interest rate above the current 12% or shorten the term—to compensate for the cash‑flow risk while still reflecting the applicant's strong creditworthiness.\"\n}"
