Given the bank's medium risk tolerance, the loan should be approved only with adjusted terms to compensate for the identified risks, e.g., a higher interest rate (around 13‑14%) or a shorter term to reduce exposure."

The applicant’s monthly expenses (≈$3,686) exceed their net monthly income (≈$3,121), resulting in a negative savings rate of -18% and an existing cash‑flow deficit. Adding a $10,000 loan at a 12% APR yields a monthly payment of roughly $338, which would deepen the deficit and increase liquidity stress. Although the credit score is good and the income trend is positive, the current debt dependence (credit‑card payment ratio >1) and lack of cash buffers make the applicant a borderline‑to‑high‑risk borrower for a medium‑risk‑tolerance bank. The justification based on “similar past approvals” is insufficient without addressing these financial stress indicators. Therefore, the decision should be reconsidered—either deny the loan or restructure it with a much smaller amount, a shorter term, or require additional collateral."
