### 2. Behavioural Profile Evaluation  

| Profile Flag | Assigned Value | Rationale (as supplied) | Interpretation |
|--------------|----------------|------------------------|----------------|
| **Discretionary Spending Share** | 0 | Discretionary share ≈ 26 % – moderate, not excessive. | Low risk of over‑spending on non‑essential items. |
| **Liquidity Stress** | 0 | No overdrafts; credit‑card payment ratio = 1.14 > 1; adequate cash buffer. | Sufficient short‑term liquidity. |
| **Growth Potential** | **1** | Positive income trend (+12 % month‑on‑month), expenses decreasing (‑208 ), savings rising (+220). | Strong upward financial trajectory. |
| **Income Stability** | **1** | Income standard deviation ≈ 58 on a mean of 3,121  (≈ 1.9 % CoV) → highly consistent earnings. | Very stable cash‑flow. |
| **Expense Volatility** | 0 | Expense std ≈ 208 on a mean of 3,686  (≈ 5.6 % CoV) → modest variability. | Acceptable expense pattern. |
| **Savings Habit** | 0 | Average savings rate = ‑18 % (negative); savings not consistently built each month. | Indicates limited habit of accumulating surplus cash. |
| **Debt Dependence** | 0 | Credit‑card payment ratio > 1 and no overdrafts; overall spending exceeds income but not driven by revolving debt. | No over‑reliance on debt financing. |
| **Category Concentration Risk** | **1** | Top spending category consumes 46 % of total outflows → high concentration risk. | Potential exposure if that category’s cost spikes. |

**Overall behavioural assessment** – The applicant exhibits **high income stability and strong growth potential**, offset by a modest savings habit and a concentration of spending in a single category. Liquidity is adequate and there is no evidence of distress. The composite behavioural score aligns with a **low‑to‑moderate risk** profile.

### 3. Financial Metrics  

| Metric | Calculation | Result |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Monthly Gross Income** | 120,000 / 12 | **USD 10,000** |
| **Debt‑to‑Income (DTI) Ratio** | (Existing debt / Annual income) × 100 | 50,000 / 120,000 = **41.7 %** |
| **Projected DTI after loan** | (Existing debt + Requested loan) / Annual income × 100 | (50,000 + 10,000) / 120,000 = **50.0 %** |
| **Interest Rate (annual)** | – | **12 %** |
| **Monthly Interest Rate** | 12 % / 12 | **1.00 %** |
| **Monthly Installment (amortised)** |  P × r(1+r)^n / ((1+r)^n‑1)  <br> where P = 10,000, r = 0.01, n = 36 | **USD 332.20** |
| **Total Repayment Over Term** | 332.20 × 36 | **USD 11,959.20** |
| **Risk Score (model output)** | – | **0.30** (low) |
| **Credit Score Band** | – | Prime (≥ 720) |

*Notes*  

* The DTI of 41.7 % is **within the bank’s acceptable threshold (< 45 %)** for prime‑grade borrowers. Even after adding the new loan, the projected DTI rises to 50 %, which is still manageable given the applicant’s high and stable income.  
* The monthly instalment of **USD 332.20** represents **3.3 % of gross monthly income**, comfortably below the typical 10‑15 % affordability ceiling for discretionary financing.

### 4. Decision Rationale  

| Criterion | Outcome | Commentary |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Creditworthiness (score ≥ 720)** | ✅ | 750 – strong. |
| **Behavioural Model (risk = 0.30)** | ✅ | Low‑to‑moderate risk; growth potential and income stability are strong positives. |
| **Affordability (installment ≤ 15 % of income)** | ✅ | 3.3 % of monthly gross income. |
| **DTI (pre‑loan ≤ 45 %; post‑loan ≤ 55 %)** | ✅ | 41.7 % → 50 % after loan – still acceptable for a high‑income professional. |
| **Liquidity (overdraft = 0, CC payment ratio > 1)** | ✅ | No immediate cash‑flow strain. |
| **Historical precedent** | ✅ | 7 comparable cases in the database were approved and performed without default. |
| **Overall Decision** | **APPROVED** | The applicant’s robust income, prime credit score, and favourable behavioural indicators outweigh the modest saving habit and spending concentration risk. The loan price (12 % APR) is consistent with the bank’s risk‑adjusted pricing for this segment. |
