### 2. Behavioural Profile Validation & Reasoning  

| Binary Profile | Assigned Value | Rationale (as supplied) | Interpretation |
|----------------|----------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| **Discretionary Spending Share** | 0 | Discretionary share ≈ 26 % (below the 30 % threshold). | Controlled discretionary spend. |
| **Liquidity Stress** | 1 | No overdrafts, but negative average savings rate (‑18 %) and expenses exceed income. | Low cash buffer – potential short‑term liquidity strain. |
| **Growth Potential** | 1 | Positive income trend (+12 ) and savings trend (+220 ) indicate upward trajectory. | Financial growth expected. |
| **Income Stability** | 1 | Income Std‑Dev ≈ 58 on a mean of 3,121 ; modest positive trend. | Stable earnings. |
| **Expense Volatility** | 0 | Expense Std‑Dev ≈ 208 on a mean of 3,686 ; no erratic spikes. | Predictable expense pattern. |
| **Savings Habit** | 0 | Average savings rate negative – applicant does not consistently save. | Weak saving discipline. |
| **Debt Dependence** | 1 | Credit‑card payment ratio > 1 and negative savings rate imply reliance on credit. | High reliance on revolving credit. |
| **Category Concentration Risk** | 1 | Top spending category consumes ~46 % of total outflows. | Concentrated spending pattern. |

**Overall behavioural insight** – The applicant shows strong income stability and growth potential, but liquidity stress, debt dependence and a concentrated spending pattern elevate the behavioural risk. These signals are acknowledged but do not outweigh the positive credit fundamentals.

### 3. Financial Analysis  

| Metric | Calculation | Result |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Debt‑to‑Income (DTI) Ratio** | Total debt ÷ Annual income = 50,000 ÷ 120,000 | **41.7 %** (below the typical 45‑50 % ceiling) |
| **Monthly gross income** | 120,000 ÷ 12 | **USD 10,000** |
| **Proposed monthly installment (incl. interest)** | \(P \times r \times (1+r)^n \big/ \big((1+r)^n-1\big)\)  <br> where *P* = 10,000, *r* = 0.12/12 = 0.01, *n* = 36 | **USD 332.56** |
| **Monthly debt service after loan** (approx.) | Existing debt service (not disclosed) + 332.56 | – |
| **Risk Score (internal model)** | — | **0.30** (low‑medium risk) |
| **Interest Rate** | Fixed | **12 % p.a.** |

*Note:* The DTI reflects total outstanding obligations relative to income; the additional loan raises the monthly outflow by only 3.3 % of gross income, maintaining a comfortable cushion.

### 4. Loan Terms & Payment Schedule  

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Principal** | USD 10,000 |
| **Annual interest rate** | 12 % (fixed) |
| **Term** | 36 months |
| **Monthly interest rate** | 1 % |
| **Monthly installment** | **USD 332.56** (rounded to two decimals) |
| **Total repayment** | 332.56 × 36 = **USD 11,972.16** |
| **Total interest paid** | **USD 1,972.16** |

### 5. Final Decision & Motivation  

| Decision | Approved |
|----------|----------|
| **Approved amount** | USD 10,000 |
| **Term** | 36 months |
| **Interest rate** | 12 % p.a. |
| **Risk score** | 0.30 |
| **Rationale** | • The applicant’s credit profile (score 750, 10‑year professional tenure, no delinquencies) is strong. <br>• DTI is 41.7 %, comfortably within policy limits. <br>• Internal risk model assigns a low‑medium score (0.30). <br>• Historical data show **7 analogous approved loans** with identical underwriting characteristics that have **not defaulted**. <br>• Positive income and savings trends offset behavioural flags (liquidity stress, debt dependence). <br>Consequently, the loan is approved under the stated terms. |

### 6. Appendices  

**A. Calculation of Monthly Installment**  

\[
\begin{aligned}
r &= \frac{0.12}{12}=0.01\\
n &= 36\\
P &= 10{,}000\\[4pt]
\text{Payment} &= P \times \frac{r(1+r)^{n}}{(1+r)^{n}-1}\\
&= 10{,}000 \times \frac{0.01 \times 1.01^{36}}{1.01^{36}-1}\\
&\approx 10{,}000 \times \frac{0.01430}{0.430}\\
&\approx \mathbf{332.56}
\end{aligned}
\]

**B. Behavioural Profile Codebook (internal reference)**  

| Code | Meaning |
|------|----------|
| 0 – Low/No risk | Behaviour within acceptable thresholds |
| 1 – Elevated risk | Flagged for monitoring / mitigated via pricing or covenants |
