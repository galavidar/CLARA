#### **Applicant Behavioural Profile Analysis**  

The applicant's behavioural profile has been assessed based on key financial metrics and their overall spending patterns:  

1. **Discretionary Spending Share:**  
   - Value: 26.1%  
   - Assessment: Moderate discretionary spending; does not qualify as high-risk.  

2. **Liquidity Stress:**  
   - Reasoning: Analysis reveals income below expenses (negative savings rate of -18.1%). High credit card utilization (113.7% of income) contributes to liquidity stress.  

3. **Savings Habit:**  
   - Value: 0 (weak savings habit).  
   - Reasoning: Historically, savings rate is negative. However, there is a strong positive trend in savings (+219.97/month), suggesting improvement.  

4. **Debt Dependence:**  
   - Reasoning: Heavy reliance on debt demonstrated by high credit card payment ratio (113.7% of income).  

5. **Income Stability:**  
   - Reasoning: Strong and consistent income trend with low income volatility (standard deviation of $57.76).  

6. **Expense Volatility:**  
   - Reasoning: Expenses are moderately volatile (standard deviation of $208.45), indicating fluctuating expenditure behavior.  

7. **Category Concentration Risk:**  
   - Reasoning: Expense concentrations in Electronics and Travel (46% of spending) reflect a potential risk of lack of diversification.  

8. **Growth Potential:**  
   - Reasoning: Positive trends in both income (+12.1/month) and savings (+219.97/month) suggest improving financial prospects.

#### **Financial Analysis**

**Loan Parameters:**  
- Loan Amount: $10,000  
- Loan Term: 36 months  
- Interest Rate: 7.00%  

**Debt-to-Income Ratio:**  
- Calculation: (Existing Monthly Debt Payments + Monthly Loan Installment) ÷ Monthly Income  
- Applicant Monthly Income: $10,000 ($120,000 ÷ 12 months)  
- Current Debt-to-Income Ratio (before loan): 50% ($50,000 ÷ $10,000)  

**Monthly Installment Calculation (with interest):**  
Using the formula for fixed monthly payments:  

\[
M = \frac{P \cdot r \cdot (1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
\]

Where:  
- \( P = $10,000 \) (loan principal)  
- \( r = 0.07 ÷ 12 \) (monthly interest rate) = 0.005833  
- \( n = 36 \) (loan term in months)  

\[
M = \frac{10,000 \cdot 0.005833 \cdot (1 + 0.005833)^{36}}{(1 + 0.005833)^{36} - 1}
\]

**Result:**  
- Monthly Installment: **$308.77**  

**Updated Debt-to-Income Ratio (after loan):**  
- Calculation: \((50,000 + 308.77) ÷ 10,000 = 50.31%\)  
- Result: **50.31%**, slightly above the industry recommendation for ≤50%. However, strong mitigating factors like high income, rising savings trends, and excellent credit score offset the slight excess.  

**Risk Score:**  
- Applicant Risk Score: 0.488 (low-medium risk).

#### **Final Decision**

**Decision:** **Accepted**  

**Motivation:**  
The applicant demonstrates excellent financial stability and reliability. While liquidity stress and debt dependence are notable concerns, the applicant’s high income ($120,000/year), strong credit score (750), and stable employment history (10+ years as a Doctor) mitigate these risks. Furthermore, the positive trends in income (+12.1/month) and savings (+219.97/month) strongly indicate an improving financial trajectory.  

Acceptance is supported by precedents from comparable cases of loan approvals for applicants with similar profiles (Cases 185001419, 194003196, 55000565). Analysis confirms that the proposed loan parameters align with the applicant’s borrowing capacity and financial trends. The interest rate (7%) reflects the applicant’s lower relative risk profile.
