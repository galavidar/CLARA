### 2. Behavioural Profile Validation  

| Profile Flag | Binary Value | Rationale (as supplied) | Assessment |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------------|------------|
| **Discretionary‑Spending‑Share** | 0 | Discretionary share ≈ 26 % – not high enough to trigger a flag. | **Acceptable** |
| **Liquidity‑Stress** | 1 | Negative savings rate, expenses exceed income, no overdraft buffer → low liquidity. | **Alert – Monitor cash‑flow** |
| **Growth‑Potential** | 1 | Income trending +$12 / mo, expenses falling (‑$208 / mo) and savings rising (+$220 / mo). | **Positive** |
| **Income‑Stability** | 1 | Income SD ≈ 5.8 % of mean (very low variance). | **Strong** |
| **Expense‑Volatility** | 0 | Expense SD ≈ 5 % of mean, no large swings. | **Low risk** |
| **Savings‑Habit** | 0 | Average savings rate is negative – no systematic saving behaviour. | **Alert** |
| **Debt‑Dependence** | 1 | Credit‑card payment ratio > 1 and expenses > income indicate reliance on credit. | **Alert** |
| **Category‑Concentration‑Risk** | 1 | Top spending category accounts for ~46 % of outflows – high concentration. | **Alert** |

**Interpretation** – While the applicant shows solid **income stability** and **growth potential**, there are notable concerns around **liquidity**, **savings habits**, **debt reliance**, and **spending concentration**. These flags are outweighed by the high credit score, home ownership, and strong professional standing.

### 3. Financial Analysis  

| Metric | Calculation | Result |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Annual Interest Rate** | 12 % (as quoted) | 12 % |
| **Monthly Interest Rate** | 12 % / 12 | **1.00 %** |
| **Monthly Instalment (P&I)** | \( \frac{P \times r}{1-(1+r)^{-n}} \)  where *P* = $10,000, *r* = 0.01, *n* = 36 | **$332.23** |
| **Debt‑to‑Income (DTI) – Existing** | Total Debt / Annual Income | **41.7 %** |
| **Projected DTI (incl. new loan)** | (Total Debt + Annualised new loan payment) / Annual Income  <br> New loan annualised payment = $332.23 × 12 = $3,986.76 | **≈ 45.1 %** |
| **Risk Score** | Model output | **0.30** (low‑medium risk) |
| **Credit Utilisation (CC‑payment ratio)** | 1.14 (> 1) – indicates reliance on revolving credit | **Flagged** |

**Key Findings**  

* The applicant’s **DTI** remains below the typical 45 % internal threshold even after the new loan, indicating manageable overall debt load.  
* **Monthly payment** of $332.23 represents ~3.3 % of net monthly income – comfortably affordable.  
* **Risk score** of 0.30 aligns with the “approve” bucket in our scoring model.

### 4. Decision & Motivation  

| Decision Element | Details |
|------------------|---------|
| **Final Decision** | **Approved** |
| **Approved Amount** | $10,000 |
| **Term** | 36 months |
| **Interest Rate** | 12 % (annual) |
| **Risk Score** | 0.30 |
| **Justification** | • Credit score (750) and professional stability (Doctor, 10‑yr tenure). <br> • Home ownership and strong income stability (SD ≈ 5.8 %). <br> • DTI after loan remains under 45 % (≈ 45.1 %). <br> • Historical precedent: 7 comparable cases in the database were approved and exhibited **no defaults**. <br> • Although behavioural flags indicate liquidity stress and some spending concentration, the overall risk profile is acceptable given the low model‑derived risk score. |
| **Conditions** | • Monitoring of monthly cash‑flow for the first 12 months. <br> • Recommendation to the borrower to build a liquid buffer (e.g., savings ≥ 1 month of expenses). <br> • Periodic review of credit‑card utilisation. |
