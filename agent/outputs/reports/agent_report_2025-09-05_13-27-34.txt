## **4. Final Decision**  

### **Decision**: Approved  

### **Motivation**:  
The applicant displays strong financial metrics overall, including stable income, responsible savings behavior, low debt reliance, and sound liquidity management. Their **DTI ratio of 18.2%** and debt repayment history further reinforce their creditworthiness. Importantly, the absence of delinquencies and bankruptcy histories demonstrates a consistent commitment to financial obligations.  

The discretionary loan purpose (**vacation**) is acknowledged as non-essential; however, historical precedence supports similar approvals for applicants with comparable metrics. Historical analysis highlights past cases (e.g., Case IDs **[114000010]**, **[119003794]**, **[204002285]**) where medium-risk loans for non-critical purposes were approved, strengthening confidence in this decision.  

### **Justification for Adjusted Terms**:  
The loan term has been reduced from **36 months** to **30 months** to mitigate exposure to expense volatility while balancing repayment affordability. The shortened term, paired with the **moderate interest rate (10.9%)**, aligns repayment to applicant stability without overstretching their financial trajectory, especially given negative trends in income and savings. This adjustment ensures both bank security and applicant manageability.
