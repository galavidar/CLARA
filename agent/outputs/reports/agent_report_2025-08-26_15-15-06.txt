### 2. Behavioural Profile Validation  

| Behavioural Flag | Binary Value | Evidence & Rationale |
|------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Discretionary‑spending‑share** | 0 | Discretionary share ≈ 26 % – not unusually high. |
| **Liquidity‑stress** | **1** | Average savings rate = –18 % (negative), credit‑card payment ratio = 1.14 (> 1), and **0** overdrafts → tight liquidity. |
| **Growth‑potential** | **1** | Income trend + 12 %/mo, expense trend – 208 $/mo, savings trend + 220 $/mo – clear upward trajectory. |
| **Income‑stability** | **1** | Income STD = 57.8 $/mo versus mean ≈ 3,121 $ (≈ 1.85 % of mean) → highly stable earnings. |
| **Expense‑volatility** | 0 | Expense STD ≈ 208 $/mo (≈ 5.6 % of mean) – modest variability, within expected range. |
| **Savings‑habit** | 0 | Average savings rate negative, indicating no consistent saving behaviour. |
| **Debt‑dependence** | **1** | Negative savings combined with CC‑payment ratio > 1 signals reliance on revolving credit. |
| **Category‑concentration‑risk** | **1** | Top spending category accounts for ~46 % of total expense – concentration risk present. |

*All behavioural assignments are corroborated by the quantitative metrics supplied in the “Reason for profile assignments” section.*

### 3. Financial Analysis  

| Metric | Calculation | Result |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Monthly gross income** | 120,000 / 12 | **USD 10,000** |
| **Proposed monthly instalment** (amortised, 12 % p.a.) |  r = 0.12/12 = 0.01 ;  PMT = r·L / (1‑(1+r)⁻ⁿ)  <br>PMT = 0.01·10,000 / [1‑(1.01)⁻³⁶] | **USD 332.00** |
| **Annualised payment for new loan** | 332 × 12 | **USD 3,984** |
| **Current debt‑to‑income (DTI) ratio** | (Total debt / Annual income) | 50,000 / 120,000 =  **41.7 %** |
| **Projected DTI after new loan** | (Current debt + New loan annual payment) / Annual income | (50,000 + 3,984) / 120,000 =  **45.0 %** |
| **Risk score (model output)** | – | **0.30** (low‑to‑moderate) |
| **Credit score** | – | **750** (excellent) |
| **Liquidity stress flag** | – | **Yes** (binary = 1) – tight cash‑flow cushion. |
| **Debt dependence flag** | – | **Yes** (binary = 1). |

**Interpretation**  

* The projected DTI of **45 %** remains within the bank’s acceptable threshold for high‑income professionals (≤ 50 %).  
* The risk score of **0.30** sits comfortably below the internal “watch‑list” cut‑off of 0.45.  
* Despite a liquidity‑stress flag, the applicant’s high and stable income, together with a strong credit score, offset short‑term cash‑flow concerns.  
* Category‑concentration risk is noted but does not materially affect repayment capacity for this modest loan size.

### 4. Decision & Motivation  

| Decision Attribute | Value |
|--------------------|-------|
| **Decision** | **APPROVED** |
| **Final rate** | **12 % p.a.** |
| **Term** | **36 months** |
| **Risk score** | **0.30** |
| **Reasoning** | The applicant matches the profile of **7 historically comparable loans** that were **approved and did not default**. Quantitative metrics (credit score 750, DTI 45 %, risk score 0.30) indicate a low probability of default. Although liquidity stress and debt dependence are flagged, the applicant’s high, stable income and positive growth trends provide sufficient cushion to service the new obligation. Consequently, the loan is approved under the stated terms. |
