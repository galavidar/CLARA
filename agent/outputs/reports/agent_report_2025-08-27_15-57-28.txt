### 3. Behavioural Profile Validation & Reasoning  

| Behavioural Flag | Binary Value | Interpretation | Supporting Evidence |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Discretionary Spending Share** | 1 | High proportion of spending on non‑essential items (≈ 26 % of total) | “Discretionary share is about 26 % of total spending, indicating a high proportion on non‑essential categories.” |
| **Liquidity Stress** | 1 | Limited cash buffers; reliance on credit cards for cash flow | Negative average savings rate (‑18 %) and CC‑payment ratio > 1 despite zero overdrafts. |
| **Growth Potential** | 1 | Improving financial trajectory | Income trend **+12 %**, expense trend **‑208 $**, savings trend **+220 $** (all month‑over‑month). |
| **Income Stability** | 1 | Consistent earnings | Income SD **≈ 2 %** of mean. |
| **Expense Volatility** | 0 | Expenditure is relatively stable | Expense SD **≈ 5.6 %** of mean. |
| **Savings Habit** | 0 | Current lack of systematic saving | Average savings rate **‑18 %**. |
| **Debt Dependence** | 1 | Dependence on credit for cash flow | CC‑payment ratio **1.14**; total expenses exceed income. |
| **Category Concentration Risk** | 1 | Heavy concentration in a single expense category (46 % of total) | “Top spending category accounts for 46 % of total expenses.” |

**Overall behavioural assessment:**  
The applicant exhibits a mixed behavioural picture. While discretionary spending, liquidity stress, debt dependence, and category concentration are flagged, the strong growth potential, very stable income, and low expense volatility offset these concerns. The professional income base and asset ownership provide additional resilience, justifying a net “acceptable” behavioural rating for the loan size requested.

### 4. Financial Analysis  

1. **Debt‑to‑Income (DTI) Ratio**  
   \[
   \text{DTI} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Annual Income}} = \frac{50{,}000}{120{,}000}=0.417\;(41.7\%)
   \]  
   *Result:* Within the bank’s acceptable range (< 45 %) for a high‑income professional.

2. **Monthly Installment Calculation**  

   - **Loan Amount (P):** $10,000  
   - **Annual Rate:** 12 % → **Monthly Rate (r):** 0.12 / 12 = **0.01 (1 %)**  
   - **Number of Payments (n):** 36  

   \[
   \text{Payment} = P \times \frac{r(1+r)^{n}}{(1+r)^{n}-1}
   \]

   \[
   (1+r)^{n} = 1.01^{36} \approx 1.4308
   \]

   \[
   \text{Payment} = 10{,}000 \times \frac{0.01 \times 1.4308}{1.4308-1}
                     = 10{,}000 \times \frac{0.014308}{0.4308}
                     \approx \mathbf{\$332.20}
   \]

   **Monthly repayment:** **$332.20**  
   **Total interest over term:** $332.20 × 36 – $10,000 ≈ $1,959.20  

3. **Interest Rate Justification**  
   The 12 % p.a. rate reflects the applicant’s risk profile (risk score 0.30) and aligns with the bank’s pricing grid for a 36‑month consumer loan to a professional with a credit score of 750.

4. **Risk Score**  
   Model‑derived **0.30** indicates a low‑to‑moderate probability of default, comfortably below the internal cutoff of 0.45.

### 5. Decision & Rationale  

| Decision Element | Detail |
|------------------|--------|
| **Final Decision** | **APPROVED** |
| **Interest Rate** | 12 % p.a. (effective monthly 1 %) |
| **Term** | 36 months |
| **Monthly Installment** | $332.20 |
| **Risk Score** | 0.30 |
| **Motivation** | • Credit score, income stability, and asset ownership are strong.  <br>• Behavioural flags are mitigated by clear upward financial trends and low expense volatility. <br>• Historical internal data shows 7 comparable loans approved under identical criteria with zero defaults. <br>• DTI is within approved limits for this applicant segment. |

**Conclusion:** The applicant demonstrates sufficient repayment capacity, a stable professional background, and a risk profile that meets the bank’s underwriting standards. The loan is therefore approved under the terms outlined above.
