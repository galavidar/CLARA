### Loan Decision Report  
**Internal Reference ID:** #LD-23-10-18  

---

#### **1. Applicant Request Summary**  

The applicant has requested a loan of **$1,800** with a **6-month term** to be utilized for **educational purposes**.  

**Applicant Details:**  
- **Employment:** Dog walker, 1 year tenure.  
- **Home Status:** Renting property.  
- **Annual Income:** $24,000.  
- **Credit Score:** 700.  
- **Monthly Debt Obligations:** $200.  
- **Financial History:** No delinquencies or bankruptcy reported.  

---

#### **2. Behavioural Profile Validation and Reasoning**  

The applicant’s financial behavior has been assessed against standard metrics, and their profile is characterized as follows:  
1. **Discretionary Spending Share:**  
   The applicant demonstrates balanced spending, with 26.9% of discretionary funds spent on non-essentials. This suggests a generally responsible allocation of funds.  

2. **Liquidity Stress:**  
   Evidence of **no overdrafts** and a **credit card payment ratio exceeding 1.0** reflects disciplined cash flow management and low reliance on debt instruments.  

3. **Growth Potential:**  
   A **negative income trend** (-$86/month), **declining savings rate** (-$1,169/month), and **rising expenditures** (+$1,084/month) indicate concerning trends regarding the applicant’s financial growth prospects.  

4. **Income Stability:**  
   The applicant’s income exhibits low volatility, with a standard deviation of $131 suggesting stable earnings despite negative trends in overall growth.  

5. **Expense Volatility:**  
   High expense standard deviation ($1,088) suggests irregular spending patterns, increasing the risk of liquidity stress during periods of heightened expenses.  

6. **Savings Habit:**  
   Although the applicant has a moderately high **savings rate** of 46.5%, significant declines in savings contribution (-$1,169/month) indicate inconsistency in their ability to sustain long-term savings.  

7. **Debt Dependence:**  
   The applicant demonstrates low reliance on debt, with manageable debt obligations and minimal dependence on credit liquidity for monthly expenses.  

8. **Category Concentration Risk:**  
   Concentrated expense allocation is apparent, with approximately 36.2% spent on their top category (Travel). The high concentration introduces susceptibility to imbalanced spending patterns during periods of financial stress.  

---

#### **3. Financial Analysis**  

The applicant’s metrics have been evaluated to assess their suitability for the requested loan.  

- **Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio:**  
  Monthly debt obligations of $200, including the proposed loan's monthly installments, represent **9%** of the applicant's monthly gross income ($2,000). A DTI ratio below **36%** is considered favorable, suggesting the applicant is in a strong position to manage additional debt.  

- **Risk Score:**  
  The computed **risk score of 0.31** indicates moderate risk exposure, particularly in light of expense volatility and declining savings trends. Cases with similar profiles have been approved in the past, albeit with risk mitigation strategies such as higher interest rates and shorter repayment terms.  

- **Interest Rate:**  
  The loan will be extended at an annual interest rate of **19%**, which is consistent with cases involving applicants of similar creditworthiness and risk factors.  

- **Loan Installments:**  
  The required monthly installments for the loan have been calculated below:  
  - **Loan Amount:** $1,800  
  - **Interest Rate (Annual):** 19%  
  - **Loan Term:** 6 months  
  - **Monthly Installment (Incl. Interest):**  
    Using the loan amortization formula:  
    \[
    M = \frac{P \cdot r \cdot (1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
    \]  
    Where:  
      \(M\) = Monthly installment; \(P\) = Loan principal; \(r\) = Monthly interest rate; \(n\) = Loan term (in months)  

    Monthly interest rate = \(0.19 / 12 = 0.01583\)  
    \(M = \frac{1,800 \cdot 0.01583 \cdot (1 + 0.01583)^6}{(1 + 0.01583)^6 - 1}\)  
    \(M = $315.09\)  

    **Monthly Installment:** $315.09

#### **4. Final Decision and Justification**  

**Final Decision:** **Accepted**  

**Justification:**  
Upon thorough evaluation, the loan application has been approved based on the following considerations:  

- A **stable income profile** with low volatility suggests reliability in meeting regular financial obligations.  
- The applicant’s **manageable DTI ratio (9%)** indicates capacity to repay the loan comfortably within the requested term.  
- The applicant has a **strong credit score (700)** and no history of delinquencies or bankruptcies, signifying historically responsible financial management.  

However, the following risk factors necessitate prudence:  
- **Expense volatility** and **negative savings trends** may pose liquidity challenges.  
- A **negative income trend** and concentrated spending categories could reduce flexibility during unforeseen financial circumstances.  

To mitigate these risks, the loan has been structured with a **6-month repayment term** and a **19% interest rate** to ensure bank risk exposure remains controlled while providing the applicant with the requested funds for education.  

Past cases with similar risk profiles (e.g., case IDs 128001010, 185000078, and 108001635) support the decision to extend the loan under similar terms and conditions.  

---

#### **5. Monthly Installments Calculation**  

**Loan Amount:** $1,800  
**Interest Rate (Annual):** 19%  
**Loan Term:** 6 months  

The monthly installment required to repay the loan is **$315.09**. Over the repayment period, the applicant will contribute **$1,890.54** (principal + interest).  

---

### **Conclusion**  

Based on the applicant’s financial metrics, behavioral profiles, and risk evaluation, the loan application has been **approved**. While certain risks exist, the structured loan terms (short-term duration and competitive interest rate) provide sufficient safeguards for both the applicant and the lender.
