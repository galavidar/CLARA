## 2. Behavioural Profile Validation  

| Behavioural Flag | Binary Value | Interpretation (per rationale) | Impact on Credit Decision |
|------------------|--------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Discretionary Spending Share** | 0 | Discretionary share ≈ 26 % – moderate, not excessive. | Neutral |
| **Liquidity Stress** | 1 | No overdrafts but a **negative average savings rate (‑18 %)** and growing cash deficits indicate limited liquid buffers. | Slight caution |
| **Growth Potential** | 1 | **Income trend +12 %** (monthly upward), **expenses decreasing (‑208 )** and **savings trend positive (+220 )** suggest improving financial capacity. | Positive |
| **Income Stability** | 1 | Income standard deviation is extremely low (≈ 1.9 % of mean), reflecting a highly stable earnings stream. | Positive |
| **Expense Volatility** | 0 | Expense volatility modest (≈ 5.6 % of mean). | Neutral |
| **Savings Habit** | 0 | **Average savings rate negative** – the applicant does not habitually set aside surplus funds. | Slight caution |
| **Debt Dependence** | 1 | **Credit‑card payment ratio > 1** and negative savings rate indicate reliance on revolving credit for consumption. | Caution |
| **Category Concentration Risk** | 1 | **Top spending category accounts for ~46 %** of total outflows, exposing the applicant to concentration risk. | Caution |

**Overall Behavioural Assessment** – The applicant displays strong income stability and growth potential, offset by limited liquidity, a lack of disciplined saving, and a modest dependence on credit. These factors are **balanced** by the high credit score and absence of delinquencies.

## 3. Financial Analysis  

### 3.1 Debt‑to‑Income Ratio (DTI)  

- **Annual Income:** USD 120,000  
- **Total Debt (outstanding):** USD 50,000  

\[
\text{DTI (annual)} = \frac{50,000}{120,000}=0.4167\;(41.7\%)
\]

A DTI below 45 % is generally considered acceptable for unsecured consumer credit. The applicant therefore sits comfortably within the institution’s risk appetite.

### 3.2 Monthly Installment Calculation  

- **Principal (P):** USD 10,000  
- **Annual Rate (rₐ):** 12 % → **Monthly Rate (rₘ) = 0.12 / 12 = 0.01**  
- **Number of Payments (n):** 36  

\[
\text{Payment} = P \times \frac{r_m (1+r_m)^n}{(1+r_m)^n - 1}
\]

\[
(1+r_m)^n = (1.01)^{36} \approx 1.430
\]

\[
\text{Payment} = 10,000 \times \frac{0.01 \times 1.430}{1.430 - 1}
               = 10,000 \times \frac{0.01430}{0.430}
               \approx 10,000 \times 0.03326
               \approx \boxed{USD 332.56\text{ per month}}
\]

The monthly obligation represents **3.33 %** of the applicant’s gross monthly income (USD 10,000), well within acceptable limits.

### 3.3 Risk Metrics  

| Metric | Value | Benchmark / Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------------------|
| **Credit Score** | 750 | Excellent (≥ 720) |
| **Model Risk Score** | 0.30 | Low‑to‑moderate risk (scale 0‑1) |
| **Liquidity Stress Flag** | 1 | Indicates need for monitoring of cash buffers |
| **Debt Dependence Flag** | 1 | Suggests vigilance on revolving‑credit usage |

All quantitative inputs lie in the range that historically correlates with a **low default propensity** for this product class.

## 4. Decision & Motivation  

**Decision:** **APPROVED**  

**Loan Terms:**  
- **Principal:** USD 10,000  
- **Term:** 36 months  
- **Interest Rate:** 12 % p.a. (fixed)  
- **Monthly Repayment:** USD 332.56  

**Rationale:**  

1. **Creditworthiness** – The applicant’s credit score (750), 10‑year professional tenure, and clean delinquency/bankruptcy record present a strong credit profile.  
2. **Income Profile** – Stable, low‑volatility income with an upward trend provides a solid repayment capacity.  
3. **DTI** – At 41.7 % the debt burden is comfortably beneath the institution’s threshold for unsecured credit.  
4. **Behavioural Signals** – While the applicant shows limited savings habit and some reliance on credit, the overall behavioural flags are offset by strong growth potential and income stability.  
5. **Historical Precedent** – Seven comparable loan cases in the internal database were approved under identical terms and exhibited **no defaults**, supporting a data‑driven confidence in this approval.  

Given the combination of quantitative metrics and qualitative behavioural insights, the loan is approved with the standard 12 % rate and a three‑year amortisation schedule. Ongoing monitoring of liquidity buffers and credit‑card utilization is recommended as part of post‑disbursement risk management.
