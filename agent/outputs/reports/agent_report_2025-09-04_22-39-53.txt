### Bank Internal Loan Decision Report

---

#### **Applicant Request Summary**
The applicant has requested a loan of $10,000 with a term of 48 months at an interest rate of **12.37%**. The stated purpose of the loan is **debt consolidation**. The applicant is employed as an **Elephant Trainer** with an annual income of **$48,000**, a job tenure of **1 year**, and a home status listed as **RENT**. Their monthly debt obligations total **$1,000**, and they have two open accounts with no prior delinquencies or bankruptcies. The applicant’s credit score is **630**, which falls into the “fair” category.

---

#### **Behavioural Profile Validation**
The applicant's financial habits and behavioral metrics have been assessed and categorized as follows:

1. **Discretionary Spending Share:**  
   The applicant’s discretionary spending share is **low (26.9%)**, suggesting limited flexibility to accommodate additional debt comfortably.  
   **Reasoning:** With discretionary spending below 30%, the applicant has limited financial elasticity in their budget.

2. **Liquidity Stress:**  
   No signs of liquidity stress identified. Overdraft frequency is **0**, savings rate is **46.54%**, and credit card payment ratio is **1.03** (suggesting most balances are cleared).  
   **Reasoning:** This reflects a well-managed financial structure free from immediate stressors.

3. **Growth Potential:**  
   The applicant exhibits **negative growth potential** due to declining trends in monthly **income (-$86.28)** and **savings (-$1169.89)** coupled with sharply rising **monthly expenses (+$1083.61)**.  
   **Reasoning:** These trends highlight deteriorating financial health and a lack of upward progression.

4. **Income Stability:**  
   Income stability is **high**, as reflected in a **low standard deviation ($131.05)**, suggesting consistent month-to-month earnings.  
   **Reasoning:** Salary consistency minimizes variations in cash flow.

5. **Expense Volatility:**  
   Monthly expenses are highly volatile, with a **standard deviation of $1088.04**, indicating unpredictability in expenditure.  
   **Reasoning:** Expense volatility represents a risk factor, as unexpected financial shocks could impair debt servicing capacity.

6. **Savings Habit:**  
   Savings habits are **strong**, with a savings rate of **46.54%**, denoting discipline in setting aside funds.  
   **Reasoning:** A high savings rate reflects positive financial behavior despite other financial stresses.

7. **Debt Dependence:**  
   Debt reliance is **low**, given that the applicant clears credit card balances and has sustainable debt obligations.  
   **Reasoning:** Low debt dependence reduces risk from over-leveraging.

8. **Category Concentration Risk:**  
   Spending concentration in the largest category is **moderate (36.15%)**, implying no excessive focus on a single expense type.  
   **Reasoning:** Diversified spending minimizes risk from disproportionate spending patterns.

---

#### **Financial Analysis**
1. **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):**  
   Monthly debt obligations total **$1,000**, against monthly income of **$4,000** ($48,000 / 12). The resulting DTI is:  
   **DTI = Monthly Debt / Monthly Income = $1,000 / $4,000 = 25%**  
   While this DTI is within acceptable limits, it does not account for expense volatility and financial trends.

2. **Risk Score:**  
   The applicant’s calculated risk score is **0.6244**. This places the applicant in the moderate-risk category. A higher risk score typically corresponds to safer applicants.

3. **Interest Rate:**  
   The proposed interest rate for the loan is **12.37%**, reflecting an evaluation of applicant risk and market rates.

4. **Installment Calculation:**  
   Using the formula for monthly loan payments:
   \[
   M = P \times \frac{r(1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
   \]
   Where:
   - \(P\): Loan principal ($10,000)  
   - \(r\): Monthly interest rate (\(12.37\% / 12 = 0.010306\))  
   - \(n\): Loan term in months (48 months)

   \[
   M = 10,000 \times \frac{0.010306(1+0.010306)^{48}}{(1+0.010306)^{48}-1}
   \]
   \[
   M = 267.00
   \]

   The monthly installment for the loan is calculated to be **$267.00**.

#### **Final Decision**
**Decision:** **Rejected**  

**Reasoning:**  
The applicant’s financial metrics indicate several areas of concern that outweigh the positive aspects of their profile:  
- **Expense Volatility:** High monthly expense volatility ($1088.04 standard deviation) signals unpredictability, posing repayment risks.  
- **Negative Trends:** Declining income (-$86.28/month) and savings (-$1169.89/month) alongside sharply rising expenses (+$1083.61/month) highlight a deterioration in financial stability.  
- **Limited Job Tenure:** With only 1 year in current employment, job stability and career progression remain uncertain.  
- **Low Discretionary Share:** At 26.9%, the applicant’s discretionary spending capacity provides minimal buffer to absorb additional debt.

While the applicant’s debt-to-income ratio (25%) and credit score (630) are within acceptable ranges, the combination of financial instability and behavioral concerns does not justify approving a loan of this size and term. Similar cases ([37001232] and [51001740]) indicate trends where applicants with comparable financial instability were either denied or approved under stricter terms for lower amounts. Additionally, cases like [161003975] and [98000991] show that higher loan amounts were accepted under stricter lending conditions, including higher interest rates and risk-adjusted terms — factors that were not feasible for this applicant.

---

#### **Conclusion**
The loan request for $10,000 over 48 months at an interest rate of **12.37%** has been deemed **unapproved** due to moderate risk score (0.6244), expense volatility, negative financial trends, and limited job tenure. Further consideration may be given for future applications if financial trends stabilize, expense fluctuations are reduced, and longer employment tenure is demonstrated.
