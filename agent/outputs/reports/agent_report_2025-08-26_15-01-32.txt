### 2. Behavioural Profile Validation  

The applicant’s transactional metrics have been mapped to eight binary behavioural flags. A brief validation and rationale are provided for each flag.

| Behavioural Flag | Binary Value | Validation Summary |
|------------------|--------------|--------------------|
| **Discretionary Spending Share** | 0 | Discretionary share ≈ 26 % – within normal limits; not flagged as high. |
| **Liquidity Stress** | 1 | No overdraft activity, but a **negative savings rate** (‑18 %) and **credit‑card payment ratio > 1** indicate limited liquid buffers. |
| **Growth Potential** | 1 | Positive **income trend** (+USD 12.1 / month) and **savings trend** (+USD 220 / month) suggest improving financial capacity. |
| **Income Stability** | 1 | Income mean = USD 3,121 with a **standard deviation ≈ 1.9 %** of the mean – very stable earnings. |
| **Expense Volatility** | 0 | Expense std ≈ 5.6 % of the mean – modest variability, not a volatility concern. |
| **Savings Habit** | 0 | Mean savings rate is **negative**, indicating the applicant does not habitually set aside surplus funds. |
| **Debt Dependence** | 1 | Credit‑card payment ratio **1.14 > 1** shows reliance on revolving credit relative to income/limits. |
| **Category Concentration Risk** | 1 | The top spending category accounts for **≈ 46 %** of total outflows – a concentration risk that may affect cash‑flow flexibility. |

**Overall Behavioural Assessment** – While the applicant demonstrates strong income stability and growth potential, there are three risk‑indicators (liquidity stress, debt dependence, concentration risk) that moderate the favourable view. These are reflected in the **overall risk score of 0.30** (low‑to‑moderate risk).

### 3. Financial Analysis  

| Metric | Calculation | Result |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Monthly Gross Income** | 120,000 / 12 | **USD 10,000** |
| **Requested Loan Amount** | – | **USD 10,000** |
| **Annual Interest Rate** | – | **12 %** |
| **Monthly Interest Rate (r)** | 0.12 / 12 | **0.01 (1 %)** |
| **Loan Term (n)** | – | **36 months** |
| **Monthly Installment (PMT)** | \(P \times r (1+r)^n / [(1+r)^n -1]\) | **USD 332.56** |
| **Debt‑to‑Income Ratio (DTI)** | (Existing Debt + New Loan) / Annual Income | (50,000 + 10,000) / 120,000 = **0.50** (50 %) |
| **Credit Score** | – | **750** (Excellent) |
| **Risk Score (model output)** | – | **0.30** |

*Interpretation*  

* **DTI of 50 %** is above the conventional 40 % threshold, driven primarily by the existing debt balance. However, the applicant’s high income and strong credit profile mitigate the apparent stress.  
* **Monthly payment of USD 332.56** represents **3.3 % of gross monthly earnings**, well within affordability limits.  
* **Risk Score 0.30** indicates a low‑to‑moderate probability of default when all variables are considered jointly.

### 4. Decision  

| Decision Component | Details |
|--------------------|---------|
| **Final Decision** | **Approved** |
| **Approved Amount** | USD 10,000 |
| **Term** | 36 months |
| **Interest Rate** | 12 % (annual) |
| **Monthly Repayment** | USD 332.56 |
| **Risk Score** | 0.30 |
| **Justification** | The applicant’s high credit score, stable and growing income, and acceptable repayment‑to‑income ratio outweigh the moderate liquidity stress and debt‑dependence signals. Furthermore, **seven comparable cases** in the internal database were approved under similar behavioural and financial profiles and demonstrated **no subsequent defaults**. Consequently, the loan is approved with the standard pricing of 12 % APR. |

---

### 5. Monthly Installment Calculation (Amortisation)

\[
\text{PMT}= \frac{P \times r \times (1+r)^{n}}{(1+r)^{n}-1}
\]

Where:  

* \(P =\) **USD 10,000** (principal)  
* \(r =\) **0.01** (monthly rate)  
* \(n =\) **36** (months)  

\[
(1+r)^{n}=1.01^{36}\approx 1.430
\]

\[
\text{PMT}= \frac{10{,}000 \times 0.01 \times 1.430}{1.430-1}
= \frac{143}{0.430}
\approx \mathbf{USD\;332.56}
\]

The payment schedule will consist of 36 equal monthly installments of **USD 332.56**, fully amortising the loan at the agreed 12 % APR.

### 6. Recommendations for Ongoing Monitoring  

1. **Quarterly Review of Liquidity** – Track the applicant’s savings rate and overdraft activity to detect any deterioration in cash‑flow resilience.  
2. **Debt‑Utilisation Surveillance** – Monitor credit‑card payment ratios and total debt balances; an increase above the current threshold may warrant early intervention.  
3. **Spending Concentration** – Observe any shifts in the top spending category; diversification of expense streams can reduce concentration risk.
