### 2. Behavioural Profile Validation  

| Profile Flag | Binary Indicator | Rationale (as supplied) | Assessment |
|--------------|------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Discretionary Spending Share** | 1 | Discretionary share ≈ 26 % (relatively high). | **Attention** – non‑essential spend is elevated. |
| **Liquidity Stress** | 1 | Negative average savings rate (‑18 %) and no overdrafts ⇒ limited liquid reserves. | **Attention** – low cushion for unexpected cash‑flow shocks. |
| **Growth Potential** | 1 | Income trending up (+$12 / mo), expenses falling (‑$208 / mo), savings improving (+$220 / mo). | **Positive** – strong upward momentum. |
| **Income Stability** | 1 | Income SD = $57.8 (≈ 1.8 % of mean) – very stable month‑to‑month earnings. | **Positive** – reliable cash‑flow source. |
| **Expense Volatility** | 0 | Expense SD ≈ 5.6 % of mean and low category volatility – spending is not highly volatile. | **Neutral/Positive** – predictable expense pattern. |
| **Savings Habit** | 0 | Average savings rate –18 % (negative) – applicant does not regularly save. | **Concern** – potential reliance on credit. |
| **Debt Dependence** | 1 | Credit‑card payment ratio = 1.14 (> 1) and negative savings indicate reliance on revolving credit. | **Attention** – higher sensitivity to additional debt. |
| **Category Concentration Risk** | 1 | Top spending category accounts for 46 % of total spend – high concentration risk. | **Attention** – limited diversification of expense categories. |

**Overall Behavioural Interpretation**  
The applicant exhibits strong **income stability** and **growth potential**, which offset several risk flags (high discretionary spend, liquidity stress, debt dependence, and category concentration). The **risk score of 0.30** (on a 0‑1 scale) reflects this balanced view.

### 3. Financial Analysis  

| Metric | Calculation | Result |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Monthly Gross Income** | $120,000 ÷ 12 | **$10,000** |
| **Proposed Monthly Installment** | PMT = P × r(1+r)^n / [(1+r)^n – 1] <br>r = 0.12/12 = 0.01, n = 36, P = $10,000 | **$332.56** |
| **Debt‑to‑Income (DTI) Ratio – Existing Debt** | $50,000 ÷ $120,000 | **41.7 %** |
| **DTI Ratio – Including New Loan** | ($50,000 + $10,000) ÷ $120,000 | **50.0 %** |
| **Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)** | Monthly Income ÷ (Existing Monthly Debt Payments + New Loan Payment) * (approx.) | Not directly supplied; however, the new payment consumes **3.3 %** of gross monthly income, leaving ample headroom given the applicant’s stable earnings. |
| **Interest Rate** | Fixed annual rate supplied | **12 %** |
| **Risk Score** | Model output | **0.30** (low‑to‑moderate) |
| **Credit Score** | Supplied | **750** (excellent) |

**Interpretation**  
- The **DTI of 50 %** remains within the bank’s acceptable threshold for professional borrowers (≤ 55 %).  
- The **monthly loan payment ($332.56)** represents **3.3 %** of gross monthly income, well below typical affordability caps (≤ 10 %).  
- The high credit score and strong income stability further mitigate the elevated discretionary and liquidity flags.

### 4. Loan Terms & Repayment Schedule  

| Component | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Principal** | $10,000 |
| **Annual Rate** | 12 % (fixed) |
| **Term** | 36 months |
| **Monthly Rate** | 1 % |
| **Monthly Installment (Principal + Interest)** | **$332.56** |
| **Total Repayment (Principal + Interest)** | $332.56 × 36 = $11,972.16 |
| **Total Interest Charged** | $1,972.16 |

### 5. Decision & Justification  

| Decision | Approved |
|----------|----------|
| **Interest Rate** | 12 % (as proposed) |
| **Term** | 36 months |
| **Risk Score** | 0.30 |
| **Justification** | 1. The applicant’s **high credit score (750)** and **stable, upward‑trending income** provide a solid repayment capacity. <br>2. The **DTI remains within policy limits**, and the **monthly installment consumes a modest 3.3 %** of gross monthly income. <br>3. **Behavioural analysis** highlights growth potential and income stability that outweigh the identified concerns (high discretionary spend, liquidity stress, debt dependence). <br>4. The **risk score of 0.30** aligns with the bank’s historical approval set – seven comparable cases in the database were approved and showed no default over the loan horizon. <br>5. No delinquencies or bankruptcy history are present. <br>**Conclusion:** The risk‑adjusted profile, combined with quantitative metrics, supports approval of the $10,000 vehicle loan under the stated terms. |

**Appendix A – Behavioural Profile Scoring Model**  
(Internal reference – not reproduced here.)

**Appendix B – Calculation Worksheet**  
- Monthly rate (r) = 12 % ÷ 12 = 0.01  
- (1 + r)^n = (1.01)^36 ≈ 1.430  
- Payment = 10,000 × 0.01 × 1.430 ÷ (1.430 – 1) ≈ $332.56  

**Appendix C – Comparable Historical Cases**  
- 7 prior loans in the same risk‑score bucket (0.28‑0.32) approved; 0 % default observed over 36‑month repayment periods.
