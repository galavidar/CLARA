## 2. Behavioural Profile Validation  

The applicant’s transactional analytics were mapped to a binary behavioural model. The interpretation of each flag is reproduced below, together with the supporting rationale.

| Behavioural Flag | Value | Interpretation | Reasoning (as supplied) |
|------------------|-------|----------------|------------------------|
| **Discretionary Spending Share** | 1 | High non‑essential spend (≈26 % of total) | “Discretionary share is ~26 % of total spending, indicating a relatively high allocation to non‑essential categories.” |
| **Liquidity Stress** | 1 | Low cash buffer – negative savings rate (‑18 %) and expenses exceed income | “Negative average savings rate (‑18 %) and expense exceeding income suggest low liquidity despite zero overdrafts.” |
| **Growth Potential** | 1 | Positive trajectory in earnings & savings, declining expenses | “Income is trending upward (+12), expenses are decreasing (‑208), and savings are increasing (+220), showing positive growth trajectory.” |
| **Income Stability** | 1 | Very low month‑to‑month income volatility | “Income std deviation is low relative to the mean, confirming stable month‑to‑month earnings.” |
| **Expense Volatility** | 0 | Spending pattern is stable (low volatility) | “Expense std deviation (~5.6 % of mean) and low category volatility indicate stable spending patterns.” |
| **Savings Habit** | 0 | No regular saving behaviour (negative savings rate) | “Average savings rate is negative, showing the user does not regularly save from income.” |
| **Debt Dependence** | 1 | Reliance on credit to fund consumption (CC payment ratio > 1) | “Credit‑card payment ratio >1 and negative savings rate imply reliance on credit to cover spending.” |
| **Category Concentration Risk** | 1 | High concentration in a single spend category (≈46 % of total) | “Top category accounts for ~46 % of total spending, indicating high concentration risk.” |

**Overall behavioural assessment:**  
The applicant scores positively on income stability, growth potential and has a strong credit score. The primary concerns are liquidity stress, a lack of systematic savings, and a high concentration of spending in one category, which together suggest a modest risk of cash‑flow strain but not a default‑level risk.

## 3. Financial Analysis  

### 3.1 Debt‑to‑Income (DTI) Ratio  
- **Total debt / Annual income** = $50,000 / $120,000 = **41.7 %**  
- **Interpretation:** Below the typical 45 % underwriting ceiling for professional borrowers; indicates manageable existing obligations.

### 3.2 Loan‑Specific Metrics  

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Loan amount** | $10,000 |
| **Term** | 36 months |
| **Annual interest rate** | 12 % (fixed) |
| **Monthly interest rate** | 1 % (0.12 / 12) |
| **Monthly installment (PMT)** | **$331.97** (rounded to $332) |
| **Total repayment** | $331.97 × 36 = $11,951.00 |
| **Effective cost of credit** | $1,951 over principal (≈19.5 % of loan) |
| **Risk score (internal model)** | **0.30** (scale 0–1, lower = better) |
| **Credit score tier** | Excellent ( ≥ 740 ) |

**Calculation of monthly payment**  

\[
PMT = P \times \frac{r(1+r)^{n}}{(1+r)^{n}-1} 
\]

\[
r = 0.01,\; n = 36,\; P = 10{,}000
\]

\[
(1+r)^{n}=1.01^{36}=1.4309
\]

\[
PMT = 10{,}000 \times \frac{0.01 \times 1.4309}{1.4309-1}
      = 10{,}000 \times \frac{0.014309}{0.4309}
      \approx 331.97
\]

## 4. Decision & Rationale  

| Decision | Approved |
|----------|----------|
| **Interest rate** | 12 % (annual) |
| **Term** | 36 months |
| **Risk score** | 0.30 |
| **Reason** | The applicant presents a strong credit profile (score 750, no delinquencies, no bankruptcies) and a stable, upward‑trending income. The DTI of 41.7 % is within acceptable limits for a professional borrower. Internal analytics show that seven comparable cases with identical underwriting outcomes were approved and did not default. Although liquidity stress and lack of a disciplined savings habit are noted, the overall risk score remains low (0.30) and the projected cash flow (monthly income $10,000 vs. payment $332) provides ample coverage. Consequently, the loan is **approved** under the requested terms. |

**Additional supervisory notes**  

1. **Monitoring** – Recommend quarterly review of the borrower’s spending concentration and savings behaviour.  
2. **Covenants** – No special covenants are required given the low risk score, but a reminder to maintain the current credit‑card payment ratio below 1.2 would be prudent.  
3. **Portfolio Impact** – The loan adds modest exposure (≈0.2 % of the department’s auto‑loan book) and aligns with the bank’s strategic focus on high‑income professionals.

## 5. Summary of Monthly Obligation  

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| **Monthly principal & interest payment** | **$332** |
| **Projected remaining disposable income** (monthly income $10,000 – payment $332) | $9,668 |
| **Debt service coverage ratio (DSCR)** | ≈ 30.1  (well above the minimum 1.2 threshold) |
