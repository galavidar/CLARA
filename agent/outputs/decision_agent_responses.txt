{
  "decision": "rejected",
  "reason": "The applicant's risk score (0.8367) is high, indicating elevated credit risk. While the credit score (720) and strong savings habit are positive factors, the applicant's income trend is negative, and expense volatility is high, suggesting financial instability. Additionally, the loan amount ($50,000) and term (60 months) are substantially larger and longer than those of similar approved cases, which could exacerbate repayment risk. Referenced similar cases [217001619, 193003043] involved lower risk scores, higher incomes, and quantities within a more manageable range.",

[2025-09-05 13-16-50] Task: Decsision
{
  "decision": "rejected",
  "reason": "The applicant's risk score of 0.5905 and financial metrics such as negative income (-80.71) and savings trends (-311.02) suggest declining financial stability and growth potential. While the applicant demonstrates strong savings habits and income stability, the moderately high Discretionary Share (27.1%) and rising expense trend (+230.31) raise concerns. Retrieved past cases [114000010, 119000360, 110000962] show that similar applicants with lower risk scores and higher incomes struggled with repayment or had late loans, despite lower interest rates. Furthermore, the loan purpose ('vacation') does not align with critical financial priorities.",

{
  "decision": "accepted",
  "reason": "The applicant demonstrates strong financial metrics, including a high savings rate (54.7%), stable income, manageable monthly debt, and no history of delinquencies or bankruptcy. The behavioral profile indicates good liquidity, strong savings habits, and low debt dependence. While the loan purpose ('vacation') is discretionary, similar past cases with non-critical purposes ('other') were approved under medium-risk interest rates (case IDs: [114000010], [119003794], [204002285]). The applicant's moderate risk score (0.5905) justifies approval with adjusted terms to align with their financial stability.",

{
  "decision": "rejected",
  "reason": "The applicant's risk score of 0.828 suggests high credit risk, primarily due to a prior bankruptcy and low credit score (580). While the applicant has stable income, high savings behavior, and no signs of liquidity stress, these positive attributes are not sufficient to mitigate the negative impact of bankruptcy history and high monthly debt ($3000) relative to income. Additionally, past cases with similar risk scores and loan purposes (debt consolidation), such as [582000406, 581004486, 582000788, 634000897, 634004037], were consistently rejected. The loan amount requested ($40,000) is significantly higher than the amounts requested in past cases, further increasing the financial risk.",
