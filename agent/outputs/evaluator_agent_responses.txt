To better compensate for the applicant's cash‑flow vulnerability while keeping the loan approved, we recommend raising the interest rate modestly (e.g., to 13%) or shortening the term (e.g., to 30 months).

While the applicant has notable risk indicators, such as negative income and savings trends and spending category concentration, their strengths in income stability and savings habits, combined with a moderate credit score (690) and lack of delinquencies, suggest they are closer to an acceptable risk profile than the rejection implies. Additionally, the risk score of 0.9246 cited in the decision lacks a clear benchmark or precise retrieval support, and precedent cases mentioned with lower risk scores had stricter terms rather than outright rejection. Adjusting terms—such as offering a higher interest rate or shorter loan term—could reduce exposure and align the decision better with the applicant's profiles and the bank's risk tolerance.
